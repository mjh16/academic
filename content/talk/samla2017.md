I am studying the efficacy of play as an organizational and pedagogical theory in ENC 2135. I am interested in students’ perceptions on play within the composition classroom, especially in the development of voice and agency in their writing. I have anecdotally seen it as a positive influence through my teaching, but I want something more empirical that I can build from.

To do the study I have prepared a material’s release form and a short survey to distribute to students. I have arranged for the distribution and collection of these materials. I will use these responses, student reflections, and student evaluations to read and code for play, voice, and agency. I will be focusing on a peer review exercise that has students speed date a draft, a collaborative activity that asks students to inhabit inquiry, and the semester reflection letter for their ePortfolios. I will develop a coding scheme (at this point I’m unsure if it will be deductive or inductive) to examine the written materials. I will use the coding, surveys, and my own observations to help triangulate the data.

I want to see first, what students think about a play infused classroom through these activities, and second, to see if there is evidence of efficacy within their reflective writings, evaluations, and surveys. I will be analyzing data over the summer. My intentions with the data analysis and presentation is to offer a way of developing voice in the composition classroom as a strategy that students can utilize.
