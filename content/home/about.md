# Biography

I am PhD Student and Graduate Teaching Assistant at Florida State University where I'm studying Rhetoric and Composition. I have interests in pedagogy, rhetoric, creative writing, and English department organization and structure, and am researching overlaps between creative writing and composition in pedagogy, curriculum, and rhetoric. I also have a growing interest in the Digital Humanities, and how to integrate digital tools and open-source approaches into my teaching, scholarship, and writing.

When not teaching or studying, I enjoy running the fantastic trails in Tallahassee, cooking, baking, and brewing beer. I am also a lifelong gamer, tinkerer, maker, and explorer.
