You find yourself sitting in a room. There is a computer in front of you playing music. There is a cup of coffee on the desk.

You take a drink and start to type.

You&#8217;ve been working on a piece that you&#8217;ve titled: &#8220;Itâ€™s Dangerous to Go Alone! Take This&#8221;: Co-op Play and the Gamified Workshop.&#8221; It&#8217;s a piece that you&#8217;ve been working on since taking _Creative Writing Pedagogy_ last fall. This article discusses a gamified workshop pedagogy. You&#8217;ve revised, and rethought it, and revised again. You used it as your writing sample for applying to PhD programs. You&#8217;re trying to get it ready for publication.

Just recently you&#8217;ve completely overhauled the lit review section, hopefully crafting a theoretical space from which to operate. It seems to have worked, even though it was difficult to do.

You stand here now, thinking about the process and how it started. Trying to dive into memory to account for the work that you&#8217;ve done to date. A simple accounting: at least 10 named drafts as its moved from the germ of an idea to where it stands now.

Along with you for this adventure are a [Cast of Characters][1].
