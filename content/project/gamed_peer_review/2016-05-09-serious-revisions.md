You stare at the open document. You&#8217;ve pulled together quotes and research notes. The weight of doing the revisions in situ seem overwhelming. You open a new document, title it Literature Review, and start typing.

You start with the major moves that you&#8217;ve seen in connecting to your own work. You create a set of bullet points that lay out your thoughts and the themes you see.

  * Process and Revision
  * Peer-Review and Troubles
  * Workshop as a collaborative and process space
  * Multimodality/Literacy/Connections between Peer-Review, Workshop, Gaming
  * Gamification as a Method of Connecting Process, Peer-Review, and Collaboration in the Workshop

Once you&#8217;ve laid it out and see the major moves, you start typing away. You integrate quotes, paraphrase, summarize, cut, paste, expand, and bridge. You feel like you&#8217;ve started to create and carve out your own space. It doesn&#8217;t feel quite right yet though. You keep working on it, pushing and pulling. Revising and seeing where it goes. You work on it until it spans almost 5 pages.

Now its time to integrate it back into the rest of the work.

Do you:
