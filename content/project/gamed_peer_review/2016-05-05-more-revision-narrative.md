Whoa, that was a lot of work. I hope that you haven&#8217;t been lost. I&#8217;ve often felt lost as I&#8217;ve explored these areas, memories, and my own process. Now that that&#8217;s out of the way, lets continue back on to adventure.

You rename the document &#8220;healy.gwp.draft1&#8221; and read through your work. There are some decent ideas here. You like what you&#8217;ve done. However, given the reading, there is a big gap in the theory section. In fact, the literature review seems rather thin.

What do you do next?

[Proceed with more reading and research?][1]

[Revise the literature review section?][2]

[Close the document and go for a run?][3]
