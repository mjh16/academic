You lace up your shoes, your new shoes, the [Altra Torin 2.0s][1]. The ones you just got last week. The ones that feel good in the way that only new shoes can. You head out into the neighborhood, your work on the tip of your mind. You click your watch to record the miles and head out.

You return home after about a 30-45 minutes, somewhere between 3 and 5 miles done. It felt good, you need a shower.

[Its time to return to work.][2]
