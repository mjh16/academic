Instead of doing any writing you choose to go back and do more research. You&#8217;ve already read three books in relationship to this article by now. What else do you need? Oh well.

Hours later, and no further writing on your draft, you have a new stack of articles that seem related. You&#8217;ve also thought about other potentials for revision, peer-review, creative writing, and multimodality that need researching.

You decide that you could research forever if you wanted to. You open healy.gwp.draft1

[Return to writing][1].
