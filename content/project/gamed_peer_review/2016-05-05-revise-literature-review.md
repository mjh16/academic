You stare at the literature review section of your article. This is one section that you really need to revise. It is unclear what work you&#8217;ve done, what the gap is, and how you fit in. Come on Michael, you can do this.

You open Evernote and locate your research notes. First you create a list with the movements of the research. You have questions like &#8220;Why do peer review?&#8221; and &#8220;Why is it difficult?&#8221; In a list under these you&#8217;ve put names like Barron, Bishop, Bruffee, Trimbur, Mayers, Jung, Yancey, Hesse, and Alexander. You start to see how they relate to each other.

Some are grouped around literacy, others the workshop, other gamification, and others still on collaboration. You start to maybe see how they interact, and where you fit it.

Do you:

[Do more research?][1]

[Start some serious revisions?][2]
