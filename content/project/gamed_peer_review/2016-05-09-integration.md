It&#8217;s time to get serious with this article! There are a number of reasons for your wanting to do this. First, you really like this idea, think it has great potential, works with your interests, and you&#8217;ve had some luck using it in your own classrooms. In fact, this semester the workshop quest seemed to work really well for a number of your students, with them starting to better see the connections between peer-review and their work, both as readers and as writers. But this stuff is hard, and you&#8217;re struggling with entering into this new discourse. Some of it is time and timing, you&#8217;ve not been at this very long, there is also the part that it is just plain difficult, and you don&#8217;t always get it quite yet. But you&#8217;re trying to make a rhetorically effective document, one that appeals to your audience of other writing teachers.

You work on bringing together your research, your position, your findings, and your ideas. You type away, bring parts in from your literature review document, integrating them, seeing how the ideas mesh. You continue to work on the article until there is not much left to do, at least not at this point in time, at least not until you can give your process and memory more time to work it over.

Things go well with the article. You revise and integrate until you turn it in to \*hopefully\* complete your independent study. You are proud of what you put together, but also realize that there is a lot of work left to do.

It&#8217;s been really interesting going back through your process in creating this narrative. There are some places where you see potentials for improvement, for re-seeing your process. There are some shortcomings, but you like where its gotten you.
