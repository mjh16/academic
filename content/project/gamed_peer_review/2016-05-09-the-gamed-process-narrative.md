Within this particular pedagogy students are asked to go back through their writing process and to create an interactive revision text. This is set up as a way for students to think about and play with memory. It is a way for them to engage with their writing in their memory as they account for how it came into being. There are a few pieces of this assignment that seem important.

  1. The first is to address the audience as a player, as someone actively working through the revision process
  2. It should account for a number of the major steps and choices that students made in writing and revision
  3. It should account for alternatives, or paths not taken.
  4. It should allow for interaction by and from the audience and they play with and through the text.

With this in mind, I would like to attempt an interactive revision text of my own. I am accounting for the process of writing and revision an article length piece that deals with gamification and the workshop (notice a theme).

In this I have gone through my memory to work through and account for my own revision process. This has also been necessarily informed by this project and others.
