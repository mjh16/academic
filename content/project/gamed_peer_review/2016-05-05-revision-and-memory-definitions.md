### An exploration of definitions:

These are the definitions that I am working with in this project. They have been founded in rhetoric and composition, though many of them are my own synthesis of theory. They have informed the production of this project.

#### What is revision?

Revision is a memory practice. Revision is a remembering strategy. Revision is recursive. Revision is a part of the writing process. Revision is a series of choices. Revision is rhetorical. Revision plays with memory.

#### What is play?

Play is language. Play is revision. Play is memory.

#### What is memory?

Memory is cultural. Memory is personal. Memory is context. Memory is genre. Memory is public. Memory is shared.

#### How does it connect?

Revision is a practice at the intersection of personal and public memories.

Play at the intersection of personal and public memories is revision.

Understanding revision is to understand play.

I would like to explore revision through an interactive revision memory practice text. I will explore choices that I have made in revision, in writing, and at play with revision.

In order to theorize and work with this idea, I need to perform the idea. This site and this project is an attempt to perform the idea as I work through it.
