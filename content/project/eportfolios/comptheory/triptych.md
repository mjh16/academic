## Triptych 1: Homebrewing Beer {#hombrewing}

I am examining the composing practices of the homebrew beer community, one that, while not an academic field, does serve as a discourse community. It is also one that I have been involved in for close to 10 years in different capacities. There are a number of different composing practices within the community, from the sharing of recipes and expertise in various forums, to the creation of recipes, to the composition of books, and the assemblage of recipes and recipe kits. I see composition as functioning in a number of ways within this community. The first is through the formulation and composition of recipes. The second is in the exchange of information through posts and discussion in online forums such as [Homebrewtalk.com] (http://homebrewtalk.com), the [r/homebrewing] (https://www.reddit.com/r/homebrewing), and the [_Homebrewers Association_] (https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/). The third is in using this collected knowledge to invent new recipes and techniques. Composition exists along with knowledge of the hombrewing process, with knowledge and literacies learned and exchanged in the process of brewing beer and writing about it.

At its core, brewing beer is the specific application of heat and time to water, hops, yeast, and grain to create the beer. While this is a simple explanation of the process, the actual application of this knowledge shows the complexity and variety of the composition process. Early on, as someone is learning the context, there is a lot of reception of pre-made composition. There is a following of formulas and pre-made recipes. There is a collection of this knowledge that people tap into as they first approach the context. From here, as knowledge is gained, people are able to add to the context. Knowledge can be used to change recipes, make new ones, adapt, and create new recipes that are then exchanged.

The compositions of homebrewing exist within complex ecologies. There are local contexts such as the brewer, their knowledge, and their reading of materials in the creation of beer. There are also local ecologies with homebrew supply stores, brewer’s leagues, and homebrew clubs. These are further connected to larger ecologies of homebrewers and knowledge in online forums, social networks, and books. This knowledge is then further shared and circulated through recipes, cookbooks, and pre-assembled kits. There are a variety of literacies and expertise that can be learned and used in homebrewing that are learned and shared.

I see this as comparable to rhetoric and composition in the variety of skill levels, depth of composition, types of publication, and forums where compositions circulate. There is a clear distinction of different skills and how they relate to the work within the field. There are a variety of activities related and within the study of both fields. They can both make products for public consumption or private reflection. They rely on a variety of different skills and expertise to respond to various situations and within different contexts.

There is also a connection to Rhetoric and Composition in the ways in which information is distributed and shared. There are informal means of composition, through the writing and sharing of knowledge from person to person. Composition are then shared on online forums, collected into recipes, and shared in everyday writing within the local communities and contexts. This is then collected into magazines and journals, with the compositions taking on a more authoritative tone in collected recipes. This knowledge is then combined into books which are circulated and sold within the same broader community contexts.

## Triptych 2: Composition as revealed/displayed in the SpaceX Hosted Webcast for Iridium 1 {#spacex}

The artifact that I will be analyzing is the SpaceX hosted webcast for the Iridium-1 satellite launch from January 14<sup>th</sup>, 2017. This marked the return to flight for SpaceX after a pad accident and explosion back in September. The webcast was available for live-streaming and is available as an archive online through [_YouTube._](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTmbSur4fcs) The stream covers pre-launch activities through the successful deployment of the payload. The webcast consists of a widescreen viewing window with a timeline at the bottom that details major events of the launch, SpaceX branding in the lower right corner, T+ (or – if pre-launch) time in the upper right corner, and relevant information taken from telemetry data also in the upper right. The middle of the screen alternates between live video of different SpaceX employees who host the cast, live video from various cameras on, in, and around the rocket and its payload. The screen will also switch to being filled by one of the video streams at various points to highlight some action or activity.

The contents of the webcast include live video, live statistics, live audio, hosts, data, timeline of events, YouTube controls, pre-recorded advertising, variety of shots, cameras, and angles, interview with the CEO of the customer talking about the payload and the relationship with SpaceX, and animations drawn from data of the flight. time elapsed, highly collaborative, features audio commentary, flight controls, video of the rocket at various stages of its flight. Throughout the webcast, the hosts offer explanations on what the current activity is during the flight. There is also live audio from the SpaceX facility that includes crowds cheering and mission control operations. The webcast also uses multiple modes—audio, video, animation, and alpha-numeric text—to effectively communicate a variety of information to various audiences.

What does this teach us about composition? First, that it is collaborative. It takes many different people with many different expertise’s to compose something. That composition exists within a specific context of a commercial rocket launch. The composition as seen in the live webcast requires pre-recorded and scripted audio/video, created animations, the exigence itself, directors, animators, scientists, and the audience to help make meaning. Secondly, that compositions are intended for multiple audiences. In this hosted webcast the audience may be an interested public, potential customers, lawmakers, or investors, among others. The composition may also have different purposes towards those audiences, to inform, to entertain, to sell, to argue for the value, to solicit investment, or to generate support for the company. These multiple purposes and audiences may overlap, compliment, or compete with one another.

Successful compositions also require different literacies and knowledges. This hosted webcast works to educate and welcome novices into the discourse community and field of commercial space flight and aerospace engineering. There is an attempt to explain and define moves and actions, as seen during minute 23 where the hosts explain the different maneuvers that the rocket and the team are undergoing, at the 25-minute mark where they are discussing the use of the grid fins on the landing rocket, and the 1:18 mark with the deployment of the satellites. This tells us that composition is situated at a confluence of multiple exigencies, audiences, and purposes, and do work to navigate in between composer(s), composition, and audiences.

## Triptych 3: The Stories of CCCC {#powell}

For the third piece of the Triptych, I choose to look at Malea Powell’s 2012 address [“Stories Take Place: A performance in One Act."] (http://www.ncte.org/library/NCTEFiles/Resources/Journals/CCC/0642-dec2012/CCC0642Address.pdf) I largely chose this piece based on the title and that it was a relatively recent address, but from before I even knew what CCCC was. In this talk, Malea (I’m using her first name based on how she represents herself in the work) presents an assemblage of stories from people about place and composition, to examine how the discipline often finds itself at intersections—between places, people, ideologies, publics, and the academy—as we teach and study. She sees these intersection as traditionally erasing people and epistemologies, and she calls on scholars in composition to do decolonializing work by teaching and presenting the stories of others alongside others. She uses the assemblage of voices and perspectives to tell the story of the conference to illustrate how “our discipline founds itself at the heart of the narrative of modernity, and it is deeply mired in the muck of the logic of coloniality” (393). She questions the passed down traditions of Rhetoric and Composition, from Aristotle on down, through the western tradition. She looks at the stories, epistemologies, people, and places that have been erased by the march of western colonization and western academic thought. In doing so, she illustrates the often-invisible perpetuation of racist, sexist, homophobic, and xenophobic ideologies that our intellectual tradition helps, knowingly or not, to perpetuate.

I was drawn to the multi-voiced and assembled nature of this presentation. It reflects, for me, so much of the important work that I see composition doing, and reflecting the sort of work that I want to do. It also expands what it means to compose, both in form and content. I found the use of place, person, story, and perspective as an important consideration to how knowledge is made in, with, and between perspectives. I also see this talk, and the decolonization that she demonstrates and calls for, as underlying many of the reasons why I am studying here.

Malea frames composition as doing vitally important work, more than just teaching writing, but in allowing people to tell stories. Stories and narratives are powerful, they are how the world is constructed. By examining the stories that we tell and are told, it is possible to start examining the ideological injustice that can infect the world of discourse. She sees rhetoric and composition as existing at the confluence of multiple rivers, of multiple epistemologies, multiple perspectives, and as a multiplicity of voices. She sees this as a strength of the discipline, and calls on us, the audience, to realize this potential. She sees composition as doing good work within many discourses, but that we ultimately limit ourselves to an oppressive western mode, intentionally or not. She asks us to examine and question our assumptions, and to broaden the stories and narratives that we see as counting, not to erase them like Cahokia. She links together story, place, and rhetoric as essential pieces of epistemology.

Ultimately, this talk frames the work of composition in activist terms. It sees the study and teaching of rhetoric and composition as means to change the world. She illustrates, through the compelling use of a variety of stories, how these other epistemologies and approaches can be used together in promoting a more just world. She ends the talk with a call to “do the thing that we do best—research, teach, mentor, administer in all the inventive and visionary ways that we all say we know how to do better than anybody else—but let’s do so in the service of a decolonized, multivocal knowledge world” (403). Rhetoric and composition can perpetuate injustice but it can also be used to move beyond it.
