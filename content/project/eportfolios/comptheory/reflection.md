### Re-inhabiting Composition

I’ve been re-inhabiting the [perspectives project] (/project/eportfolios/comptheory/perspectives) this last weekend, while also working on this reflection and having various levels of success baking bread. I was working with Jessi through the unedited video of the interview to transcribe and code a section of it for research methods. As I was listening again to what Ned Stuckey-French had to say about composition, composing, writing, tools, technologies, and teaching, there was a phrase that he used, “letting the language lead”, that stood out. He was talking about language in a very craft focused way, working from John D’Agata and the essay, but it seems so very central to my own work and interests. At the core of composition is language inscribed, and an activity on a page. A pushing around of graphite or bits to explore and share ourselves through language, and hoping that it leads to sometimes to someone somewhere.

Letting the language lead. It all seems very lyrical, impressionistic, and idealistic, but I’m going to run with it. This moment represents a large revision in this reflection, of really letting the language lead towards what I'm reflecting on and trying to synthesize. I see it arising out of the perspectives project, but also as emerging this semester as I’ve been re-inhabiting composition theory. We know that composition is intentionally doing something with language as a representational system that is social and epistemological in nature. Language leads people down the pathways and interconnections of activities and networks. Communities of practice develop out of the coalescing of language around an activity, and discourse communities take this further by codify language into genres and knowledge. But, at its core, language leads people to others and their ideas. They then react, respond, and perhaps even see the world differently. And here is the core of what we know about composition: That it is a way of inscribing meaning and doing work through language.

### Looking Back

#### What do we know about composing?

So, to take this a little further. We know that composition is the inscription, via language (broadly), onto something (loosely), with the intention of affecting someone or something else at a subsequent time and/or space (and if you take a cosmic view, they are both always shifting and changing). So, in order for a material inscription (even a digital composition starts with a person at an interface) to be considered composition it needs to be intentional, it needs to be rhetorical, and it needs to circulate to an audience. These seem to be things that I understand that we know about composition as I stand here near the end of my second semester here at Florida State.

We know from research that composition has a history that is multidimensional, layered, responses to different exigences, and is highly contextual. The individual selections and reflections, [a SRR on history] (/project/eportfolios/comptheory/selection1), [an SRR on WAC/WID/WEC] (/project/eportfolios/comptheory/selection2), and [a blog post] (/project/eportfolios/comptheory/selection3), all had a focus on the history of composition in some way. Skinnel’s approach in “Conceding Composition,” looked at how the composition program developed alongside Arizona State University as a means of legitimizing the work of the university. Composition and writing are seen as an important aspect of literate and university discourses, and examining this and similar histories sees how the field and discipline evolved alongside. It also allows for the narratives and stories to be interwoven, and to see contextually how and why they developed. This historical narrative gives additional context and framing to Emig, Shaugnessey and Elbow, in how they were developing theories and research out shifting and changing literacy contexts.

It was also interesting to think of literacy and history alongside the development of WAC/WID programs. While I had a difficulty with Condon and Rutz, finding their exploration of taxonomies at times reductive, putting it together with Russel, and in the contextual historical framework, helps to see how composition has evolved through people responding differently in their own contexts. So, in these ways, I see my reflections and selections illuminating the narratives, stories, and histories of composition. They reflect a naming of what we know, and where that knowledge came from. They provide important antecedents. I find this interesting, and it was not at all intentional. It does follow from my own interests of wanting to get in and tinker with the stuff of composition and writing, to see what the system is and to suppose how it may tick. I tend to find histories compelling in the narratives and stories they tell, and how they perform important rhetorical work in arguing for an antecedent and need for attention on an issue or need.

### Looking Across

#### How do we know it?

We know this from inquiry. From asking each other and our artifacts about their purposes, about their audiences, about their circulations, and about their reasons for turning to inscribed language to do something. I found the readings that we did, especially in the contemporary research from Shipka, Flash, and Roozen (really much of _A Rhetoric of Reflection_ as well as _Naming What We Know_), as instructive for examining how and what we know about composition, and for making arguments for why it is important. These inquiry and reflective projects let us see something about how composition is operating in the world, and moves it beyond just our classrooms or academic contexts. Through the study of composition, we know a lot more about how and why people engage with language, the processes by which they compose, the materials and practices used, and how best to approach the teaching of the content and context of composition. We also know that we have a lot yet to learn.

In this way, I found both the [Triptych] (/project/eportfolios/comptheory/triptych) and [Perspectives projects] (/project/eportfolios/comptheory/perspectives) useful in seeing how composition is social and rhetorical, and how it interacts out in the world to do work. We also know that composition represents, reproduces, and shares identities and ideologies. It provides a means for people to situate themselves in relationship to discourse and to exert some power upon it. It can also be used epistemologically within this same system. We know this because we can see, and study, and teach, how language has power and creates changes in the material world.

I saw interesting connections between the [Triptych, in which I looked at a SpaceX hosted webcast, the homebrewing community, and Malea Powell’s CCCC address] (/project/eportfolios/comptheory/triptych) as having interesting connections to Pamela Flash’s WEC reflective practices. All three investigations, and the reflective overlay, as “questions about how writing is being defined, and about the stability and implications of those definitions” (Flash Kindle Locations 5380-5382). Through a multiple look at composition practices in-situ, we are able to articulate how and what we know. It is interesting to look back on this project now and see the networks, discourse practices, the ways in which people are brought into the conversation, the multivoicing, and contextual nature of it. They represent some of Brandt and Clinton’s “glocal,” along with a conventionalized push on social conventions as explored in Devitt and Miller.

[The perspectives project] (/project/eportfolios/comptheory/perspectives) let me see how someone within English, but with a different focus, connect a large amount of composition theory to his own practices. I was really interested in Ned Stuckey-French's articulation of Macrorie, Elbow, and Yancey as important influences in his own writing and in his teaching/learning from students. Though not articulated in the same terms, he had a clear understanding of the social, cognitive, and rhetorical nature of composition. It was also interesting to see a different perspective on composition, and what that looks like in terms of the process of production. In looking back through the project now, I find it interesting how much of the process is the same, regardless of what the project is that he is working on, and how he adapts to the needs of his audience or of the text. I see connections to both Russel and Yañez in how the learning and writing is “social in origin, and human activity as collective.” It illuminated how much of composition is interwoven and interconnected, and how effective composers realize and utilize that knowledge and those connections.

Additionally, I continue to see, and I’m working to better articulate, connections between composition and creative writing. One of the clearest connections are to creative nonfiction, especially with its very rhetorical foundations of truth telling. I think this was why I was drawn to both Doug Hesse and Ned Stuckey-French for the perspectives project. But, I see a continuing outward circling of composition being an important was of situating oneself in the world, and that creative writing is a way of responding out of that situating. It exists within different social contexts and conventions, but it still looks to mediate activity between people through language.

I have also continued to see connections to the materiality and technology of writing. I found and continue to find Shipka’s work intriguing, and materiality is why I chose the [Digital Scholars blog post] (https://digitalscholars.wordpress.com/2017/02/12/look-at-all-this-stuff-on-playing-printing-and-virtual-reality-in-the-digital-humanities/) for an outside artifact. I chose it as it was a response to digital technologies that were about making and embodiment. I see that we have often forgotten about, or relegated to lore, the physical realities of writing, and Shipka helps to illuminate that. Additionally, Gere and Yancey et. al remind us of the other, everyday, and material realities of writing. I enjoy how the blog post for the Digital Scholars group deals with technology and exploring other composing practices and processes. It was also fun to play around with the tools.

The second outside artifact that I chose was an [assignment prompt from my 2135 class for an exploratory collaborative activity.] (https://atplaywithcomposition.wordpress.com/exploratory-2-interest-and-inquiry/) I chose this for multiple reasons, but mostly because I see it as an enactment of many of the social, inquiry, collaborative, and epistemological facets of composition, and it does so within a composition classroom. I saw a connection within this to the idea to Trimbur in having students use "consensus as a critical instrument" (745) to examine how they go about inquiry and investigation, and how it relates back to their research. I also like this prompt, this writing, and the resulting work, because it shows much of what we know about composition, especially in engaging with a Bruffian "conversations" between each other and their research. I also see it as an invitation for students to work within their different expertise, and assemble a response and reflection out of it. I like how it works to inhabit and illuminate inquiry as an important topic of composition for students, and how it asks myself and my students to perform and play with some of the key concepts of composition.

This leads directly to my [final project] (/projects/eportfolio/comptheory/abstract), where I am proposing a talk and study based on my own classroom teaching this semester. I see it as an intersection of play, pedagogy, and composition, looking to examine not only what students know, but how they know it and why it is important. I also see it as examining play on students’ perceptions on learning and utilizing voice, agency in adapting to composing assignments, and the efficacy of play as evident within their writing. I see this as building on the social and rhetorical aspects of composition, and building within activity theory as a means of inhabiting and exploring concepts involved with composition, and examining connections between inquiry, process, and literacies.

I had found solid ground this semester in the key-terms and threshold concepts. I particularly found _Naming What We Know_ and the threshold concepts within useful. I have returned to the eBook from the library a number of times as we have worked through an idea this semester, and have used some chapters in this class, research methods, and introduced it to my own students. Some key terms and concepts from this semester have been: Genre, activity theory, process, difference, ideology, community, and materiality. I see rhetorical ecologies and the social nature of composition cutting across the collected artifacts of this ePortfolio.

### On looking forward

#### Why or How is What We Know Important

I have learned that composition is ecological, it is material, it is cognitive, it is social, it is rhetorical, it is a process, and it is multimodal. On looking back: I see a slow and gradual development of my own approaches to composition theory and practice. This semester did feel more like “home” to me, in the sense that there were a lot of familiar readings, names, and concepts from prior classes, study, research, and pedagogy. My formal introduction to rhetoric and composition was through a class titled “Composition Theory and Pedagogy.” I see myself continuing to bring in a variety of experiences, and to think about ways in which to integrate and implement them.

I continue to see composition and composing practices functioning within an ecological network of activities. I continue to find Rice’s rhetorical ecologies a useful and productive means of examining and looking at how rhetoric infuses composition, and compositions travel through the world. I’ve found this a useful stance to think about the growth of individuals, the evolution of genres, and the ways in which compositions change and are changed by the various material, social, and cognitive environments in which they circulate.

So, composing is a social and rhetorical activity, where language—in its many myriad forms, modes, media, and interfaces—mediates an activity between two agents. I see this acting as an evolution from my position at the beginning of the semester, and I see it evident within the selections that I have made for my ePortfolio. In looking back over the semester, I now see stronger connections between composition and rhetoric, especially in the epistemological nature of composition. I also see more of the activities that are involved in composition beyond the nature of the act itself. I am left wondering about how we best teach composition moving forward, and what that will mean in continuing to develop adaptive and responsive pedagogies and practices in the 21st century. In many ways, we need to really get on it, as has been reflected in our most recent readings.

Composing is the act of creating something material (and I think of this loosely) with the intention of it doing some work with an audience, or between composer, text, and audience. It is an intentional creation of a text (again broad), that has some intended effect. This effect is, in many cases, rhetorical. There is also a clear tension between the intentions of composition and how they are realized. We know that composing is something that people do with the intention of communicating with other people across both space and time. We also know that there are a variety of practices, contexts, languages, genres, and perspectives involved in composition. We also know that it is a different process between different people, and that there isn’t a universal set of composing practices.

#### What else do we need to know any why?

What we know helps us to develop strategies for approach situations to which we can respond, potentially rhetorically, through composition. Additionally, knowing that composition is an interpersonal, distributed, and networked practice helps us to teach composition, or good composing practices to others, and to examine how and why compositions function in the world. I want to take some of these ideas from this semester directly into other classes, my own research, turn the final project into a conference proposal, and to think about ways in which I can continue doing and working with composition in creative ways. I see both genre and activity theory playing important roles in my formulation and approach to composition scholarship and teaching. I also see that networks and ecologies will continue to play a role in how I see my work within rhetoric and composition.

I think that I am particularly interested in what composition looks like in universities, in English departments, in other departments, in other disciplines, and in other contexts. This is broad, and it really does encapsulate what composition is as a discipline, but it does let me know that I am in the right place. I want to look at how Composition is taught and how it is situated in universities, and I want to see what the relationships are between Composition, English, and Creative Writing. I want to see how WAC and WID are articulated in our own academic homes, and how we can continue to teach and help others in teaching of and with composition in their own contexts. This interest also lets me know that we need to continue to think about how, where, and why people compose, especially in genre choices, technology, and embodiment.

All this to say, that I think I am becoming more of a WAC/WID person, and this is something that I would not have imagined coming into this program. Additionally, I still see the core of my interests still lying in the overlaps and cross-pollinations between creative writing and composition.
