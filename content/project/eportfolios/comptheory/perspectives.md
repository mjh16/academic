Embedding the video here also allows me to do some additional contextual work. [Much of what Ned Stuckey-French has written can be found at his website.] (http://nedstuckeyfrench.com) He is someone, who in his responses and his writing, crosses many boundaries, and seems to invite others to do the same. His perspective is one of learning from students on writing and composing practices, seeing his work in the classroom as informing and influencing his own. His responses also highlighted how composition is embodied and is influenced by habits, culture, tools, and location. There was a sense that writing did something in connecting his own experiences with others, and to learn something while doing so.
