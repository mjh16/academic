After a presentation and conversation with [Alex Gil](https://digitalscholars.wordpress.com/2017/04/24/alex-gil-followup/), I've chosen, as a summer project, to re-do my personal website, for a few reasons:

  1. To better know the technologies I use.
  2. To better, and more openly, represent my work.
  3. To have more control over my making. I would like to know where the things I'm doing are going.
  4. To get off of a self-hosted Wordpress site.

These is a big project for the summer, but luckily, I think it is working out.

So, I've made some of the first things that I need to do with the site.
