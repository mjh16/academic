So I've been thinking about how to organize and work through all of this. Both in terms of templating, as well as in terms of theming and organization. I currently have the personal stuff offset in its own subfolder, which I would either like to figure out how to place into its own subdomain, or something. I will need to figure out how to do that. There are things that I like with this [Academic] (https://themes.gohugo.io/academic/) theme, especially in terms of it "looking" like a CV. And I like the idea, ultimately, of having a CV type academic site, with resources based on the different projects. To have data available, slides, references, etc. Speaking of which, I need to do that for my [CCCC's talk] (/talk/cccc2017) from this year. I also like that there is a lot to customize, but that it largely just works, and is relatively well documented.

I should follow up on a bug, I think, but I also need to do more to learn some additional CSS. Oh well, one summer project at a time.

I am planning on adding a "book review" section here, as a way of thinking through the different things that I've been reading for the summer DIS. I also see this sort of scholarship archive, and my reactions to it--more casual and blog like than publishable book review--as a way of reflecting on and synthesizing my reading, as well as a means for creating a publicish archive. I'll need to see how extensible this theme is before committing to it.
