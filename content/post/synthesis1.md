We had our first meeting for our summer WPA directed independent study. To help frame the discussion, Dr. Yancey proposed that we first do a thumbnail sketch of the main topics and arguments for each of the readings[^1], and then to do connections and contradictions between the various pieces. We had a (productive discussion) [post/wpa-dis-meeting1], though we cover much in the way of connections. post here is an initial attent to do some of that work across and between the texts. Together, the selections offered a look at what a writing program is, and issues of teacher preperation, Gradutate Teaching assistants, curriculum, and pedagogy. The selections spanned at least 20 years of scholarship, offering particular looks into the theories and contexts of writing programs, and providing some foundation for writing program administration.



[^1] The text selection included: Coxwell-Teauge, Deborah, and Ronald F. Lunsford eds. *First-Year Composition: From Theory to Practice*,  Petraglia, Joseph. *Reconceiving Writing: Rethinking Writing Instruction*, Pytlik, Betty P., and Sarah Liggett. *Preparing College Teachers of Writing*, and a selection of articles.
