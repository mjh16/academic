&lt;h3 id=&#34;coxwell-teague-deborah-and-ronald-f-lunsford-eds-first-year-composition-from-theory-to-practice-parlor-press-anderson-sc-2014&#34;&gt;Coxwell-Teague, Deborah, and Ronald F. Lunsford eds. &lt;em&gt;First-Year Composition: From Theory to Practice&lt;/em&gt;. Parlor Press, Anderson, SC, 2014.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This edited collection provides theoretical background for a hypothetical first-year composition class. Coxwell-Teague and Lunsford ask the contributors&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;ldquo;what they would do if they taught semester-long first-year composition course at their schools and if they knew such courses were to be the only college-level composition course the students would take&amp;rdquo; (preface viii)? Each chapter is separated into two halves: theoretical frame and a syllabus. In the first section of each chapter, the contributors offer the rationales for their design of the course, each highly representative of their own interests and their contexts. The second half of the chapter are supplementary materials, each with a syllabus, and many with assignment sheets. Overall, the collection offers a snapshot of what many scholars in Rhetoric and Composition see as the important features of this class. There are many commonalities among them, where FYC does not focus on grammar, persuasion, or on the &amp;ldquo;improvement of writing&amp;rdquo;. Overall, the collection offers an interesting look at what the core teaching practices and focuses of the discipline are, and where they fit within First-Year composition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found the class designs and syllabi really engaging. It has me actively thinking about both how to design my classes this summer and fall, and also thinking about how we talking about and theorize curriculum design. I find this especially useful in the connections between design and assessment, and how transparent (or not) that connection is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This edited collection rethinks and theorizes what writing is.&lt;/p&gt;

Oxford UP, Oxford, 2002.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This edited collection examines issues of curriculum design, teacher preparation, graduate teaching assistants, labor, pedagogy, and practice. It has an extensive list of contributors &lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and the chapters were organized around the themes histories, theories, programs, and practices. The provided chapters offer a snapshot into program design, preparation, curriculum, education, support, and local contexts for a variety of teaching assistants, adjuncts, faculty, and professors teaching college writing. The chapters tended to reflect the local nature of the program, outside of some that took a winder stance such as Yancey&amp;rsquo;s heuristic for curriculum design. Overall, the chapters tended to get repetitive, with many offering similar types of programs with various levels teacher preparation and support. There were things to be learned in terms of the framing, content, and ongoing programs that teachers of composition need, and how to structure programs and curriculums. This volume, as compared to the others, was light on theory but had lots of on-the-ground types of insights and explorations&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;restaino-jessica-first-semester-graduate-students-teaching-writing-and-the-challenge-of-the-middle-ground-southern-illinois-up-carbondale-2012-ebook&#34;&gt;Restaino, Jessica. &lt;em&gt;First Semester: Graduate Students, Teaching Writing, and the Challenge of the Middle Ground.&lt;/em&gt; Southern Illinois UP, Carbondale, 2012. eBook.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this monograph, Restaino studies the first semester teaching experiences of four first-semester graduate teaching assistants as they navigate the multiple roles of graduate teaching assistants. She uses Hannah Arendt&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;ideas about beginnings, about necessity, and about work&amp;rdquo; to examine the ways in these four student/teachers form their teaching personas, work through difficulties, theorize their classrooms, and situate their work/labor at &amp;ldquo;Public U.&amp;rdquo; Restaino by presenting the context that the students were presented with: a 3 day orientation, a semester long practicum, an assigned syllabus and schedule, and ongoing mentoring. She also notes the methods and methodologies that she utilized in her study, with an attentive, ethnographic, participant-observer as the primary means of data collection. This included the observation of the four teaching, email interview, the collection of student writing, and the offer for mentoring/support throughout the semester by meeting with the group over drinks, as well as through email. Using Arendt&amp;rsquo;s theories about labor, consumerism, and the human condition, she examines how the four students develop and maintain a sense of agency and identity through meaningful work, rather than falling into the traps of meaningless labor to survive. This analysis offers meaningful explorations where these students were successful, and painful narratives where they weren&amp;rsquo;t. This was especially true with her narrative and analysis of Tess and Nancy, with Tess&amp;rsquo;s issues establishing &amp;ldquo;authority&amp;rdquo; and the struggles with Philosophy Phil, and the ways in which Nancy constructed her persona as detached, and doing the teaching on her own terms. While Restaino is careful in her conclusions to not generalize from this particular semester-long, contextual, case study, she does suggest that this sort of localized analysis of graduate students and non-tenured faculty can help understand and adapt education and support programs for these new teachers. Additionally, it offers a different means of theorizing labor/work in composition programs, and can offer WPAs a different means to design and assess their programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found the book overall intriguing and thought provoking. The detailed narratives and case studies offered a look into a particular set of graduate students and WPA concerns. Given her methodological stance, Restaino raised many questions through her analysis, and offered a potential framework to adapt to local contexts. However, I felt as if there was much that could be further explored throughout the text and in further analysis. This was a very interesting read in thinking about the Strickland and Gunner collection, and with the theorizing of labor and laboring from Asoa Inoue.&lt;/p&gt;

Boyton/Cook, Portsmouth, 2009.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This edited collection examines issue surrounding the professionalization of composition and writing studies, especially as experienced by WPAs, and the people that they work with and for. There is a range of contributors&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, showcasing a variety of experiences and perspectives. There is an attention paid to issues of what counts as work and labor, and the issues that have arisen out of the teaching of composition and the development of writing programs under the administration of WPAs. Additionally, there are calls for continued work in detailing and accounting for the variety of work and labor that occurs within Writing Programs as expressed in their various local contexts. The chapters ranged in their discussions from history, to development of TA and WPA theory, and the real labor implications of the work of WPAs. There was a call for tenure line and tenured WPAs in institutions, for better accounting for teaching and administration as important intellectual work, and for implementing policies, procedures, and mindsets that help to address the labor and staffing inequities that are present in many writing programs. There were examinations of the labor of WPAs, adjuncts, full-time faculty, and GTAs. The most salient chapters dealt with the rhetorics of programs, their local context, and how they can be both theorized and implemented in more just and equitable ways. These chapters were also able to make some detailed analysis of programs, and offer some generalizable insights out of them. However, there were a number of chapters that were either not as strong, or dealt with an issues/exploration that seemed overly contextual, without adding to broader understandings of the labor of WPA work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book, to me, was hit-or-miss. There were some chapters that were exceptionally strong, especially in considering the working conditions, political realities, and labor issues associated with the teaching and administration of writing programs. The concern here for examining the &amp;ldquo;consolidation of the field of writing program administration under the forces of managerialism, professionalization, and the economic systems of both, with resulting material practices that serve to limit the nature of WPA work, though not its culturally conservative effects&amp;rdquo; (xiii). Many of the issues expressed here appeared in narratives presented by Restaino, and in the design of classes presented in Coxwell-Teague and Lunsford.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <link>http://michaelhealy.space/academic/project/gamed_peer_review/2016-05-09-conclusions/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2016 06:23:04 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://michaelhealy.space/academic/project/gamed_peer_review/2016-05-09-conclusions/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is an idea that is relatively new, but I think there is great promise in it. Working through the process of performing the revision narrative has been an interesting one. Its one that I knew wouldn&amp;#8217;t be easy, but has also proven to be more difficult than I had at first imagined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[aesop_character img=&amp;#8221;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.michaelhealy.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img_0415-e1462474741733.jpg&amp;amp;#8221&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;http://www.michaelhealy.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img_0415-e1462474741733.jpg&amp;amp;#8221&lt;/a&gt;; name=&amp;#8221;Process&amp;#8221; align=&amp;#8221;left&amp;#8221; width=&amp;#8221;40%&amp;#8221; force_circle=&amp;#8221;off&amp;#8221;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing has been purely logistical. In performing this on my WordPress site, I have had flexibility to move and connect things as I would like, to relate posts together through smart linking and decision trees.But I have found that the accounting requirements to keep track of the links and related elements difficult. I will need to develop a workflow to troubleshoot for students. There will need to be a certain amount of teaching the technology necessary in implementation. I think that it could be done in a similar hypertext, especially with the digital and multimodal affordances of WordPress as a platform, but there will need to be necessary development work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[aesop_character img=&amp;#8221;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.michaelhealy.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/memory.jpg&amp;amp;#8221&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;http://www.michaelhealy.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/memory.jpg&amp;amp;#8221&lt;/a&gt;; name=&amp;#8221;Memory&amp;#8221; align=&amp;#8221;left&amp;#8221; width=&amp;#8221;40%&amp;#8221; force_circle=&amp;#8221;off&amp;#8221;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found the work with memory really surprising. I was fully expecting to find some interesting tidbits in my process. I&amp;#8217;ve always found that reflective and process texts very useful and enlightening. I wasn&amp;#8217;t expecting the level of play with my process to give me as much as it would, especially in considering what else I did while writing. There are other things that I could have accounted for in the text, from placement, to music, to equipment, to the choices that I make at different points related to my writing. When I work on paper, when I turn to a computer, the back-and-forth through research and writing and back again. I have always found my process iterative, going back through data and writing again and again, but I wasn&amp;#8217;t expecting the interplay with my process and memory in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[aesop_character img=&amp;#8221;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.michaelhealy.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img_0406.jpg&amp;amp;#8221&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;http://www.michaelhealy.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img_0406.jpg&amp;amp;#8221&lt;/a&gt;; name=&amp;#8221;Revision&amp;#8221; align=&amp;#8221;left&amp;#8221; width=&amp;#8221;33%&amp;#8221; force_circle=&amp;#8221;off&amp;#8221;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&#34;ui-id-2&#34;&gt;
  I did find that I was doing a fair amount of revision in the production of this text, especially in terms of how I was utilizing memory. In explicitly invoking and playing with memory, I found that I was often moving between paper notes, Evernote, word documents, and my WordPress site here. This interplay of memories and materials was important. This is really indicative of how memory is a generative force, and revision is a generative force, and how revision is a fully embodied process.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[aesop_character img=&amp;#8221;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.michaelhealy.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img_0261.jpg&amp;amp;#8221&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;http://www.michaelhealy.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img_0261.jpg&amp;amp;#8221&lt;/a&gt;; name=&amp;#8221;Play&amp;#8221; align=&amp;#8221;left&amp;#8221; width=&amp;#8221;33%&amp;#8221; force_circle=&amp;#8221;off&amp;#8221;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&#34;ui-id-3&#34;&gt;
  I found the ideas of play and gaming central to this work. This type of interactive process narrative asks for students to try, fail, revise, learn, and generate knowledge about themselves and how they think and write. The idea that play is important, though not always fun, and the permission to fail productively, was key to this idea and exploration of process and revision. The gamification, the idea of choices, and making evident the various choices was really important. In revisions of this idea, being able to better account for various choices, and having more time to think about and work through them, will be useful.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an approach that will continue to need to be revised and worked with. I think that&amp;#8217;s what is so exciting about this, is that it wants to continue to be played with. I don&amp;#8217;t know how students will react to this, but I think that it could be a really productive, different, and generative way for them to engage with writing. I think this is especially true in the ways that they are asked to utilize memory as a generative force.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You open up healy.gwp.draft2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    [aesop_character img=&amp;#8221;http://www.michaelhealy.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img_0406.jpg&amp;#8221; name=&amp;#8221;Revision&amp;#8221; align=&amp;#8221;center&amp;#8221; width=&amp;#8221;100%&amp;#8221; force_circle=&amp;#8221;off&amp;#8221;]
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s time to get serious with this article! There are a number of reasons for your wanting to do this. First, you really like this idea, think it has great potential, works with your interests, and you&amp;#8217;ve had some luck using it in your own classrooms. In fact, this semester the workshop quest seemed to work really well for a number of your students, with them starting to better see the connections between peer-review and their work, both as readers and as writers. But this stuff is hard, and you&amp;#8217;re struggling with entering into this new discourse. Some of it is time and timing, you&amp;#8217;ve not been at this very long, there is also the part that it is just plain difficult, and you don&amp;#8217;t always get it quite yet. But you&amp;#8217;re trying to make a rhetorically effective document, one that appeals to your audience of other writing teachers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You work on bringing together your research, your position, your findings, and your ideas. You type away, bring parts in from your literature review document, integrating them, seeing how the ideas mesh. You continue to work on the article until there is not much left to do, at least not at this point in time, at least not until you can give your process and memory more time to work it over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things go well with the article. You revise and integrate until you turn it in to *hopefully* complete your independent study. You are proud of what you put together, but also realize that there is a lot of work left to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s been really interesting going back through your process in creating this narrative. There are some places where you see potentials for improvement, for re-seeing your process. There are some shortcomings, but you like where its gotten you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Serious Revisions</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You stare at the open document. You&amp;#8217;ve pulled together quotes and research notes. The weight of doing the revisions in situ seem overwhelming. You open a new document, title it Literature Review, and start typing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You start with the major moves that you&amp;#8217;ve seen in connecting to your own work. You create a set of bullet points that lay out your thoughts and the themes you see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Process and Revision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Peer-Review and Troubles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Workshop as a collaborative and process space&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multimodality/Literacy/Connections between Peer-Review, Workshop, Gaming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gamification as a Method of Connecting Process, Peer-Review, and Collaboration in the Workshop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;#8217;ve laid it out and see the major moves, you start typing away. You integrate quotes, paraphrase, summarize, cut, paste, expand, and bridge. You feel like you&amp;#8217;ve started to create and carve out your own space. It doesn&amp;#8217;t feel quite right yet though. You keep working on it, pushing and pulling. Revising and seeing where it goes. You work on it until it spans almost 5 pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now its time to integrate it back into the rest of the work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.michaelhealy.info/2016/05/integration/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Work on integrating the Literature Review into your main body?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.michaelhealy.info/2016/05/run/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Go for run?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Gamed Process Narrative</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Within this particular pedagogy students are asked to go back through their writing process and to create an interactive revision text. This is set up as a way for students to think about and play with memory. It is a way for them to engage with their writing in their memory as they account for how it came into being. There are a few pieces of this assignment that seem important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first is to address the audience as a player, as someone actively working through the revision process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It should account for a number of the major steps and choices that students made in writing and revision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It should account for alternatives, or paths not taken.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It should allow for interaction by and from the audience and they play with and through the text.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, I would like to attempt an interactive revision text of my own. I am accounting for the process of writing and revision an article length piece that deals with gamification and the workshop (notice a theme).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this I have gone through my memory to work through and account for my own revision process. This has also been necessarily informed by this project and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.michaelhealy.info/2016/05/more-revision-narrative/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Time to start the narrative.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The ones you just got last week. The ones that feel good in the way that only new shoes can. You head out into the neighborhood, your work on the tip of your mind. You click your watch to record the miles and head out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You return home after about a 30-45 minutes, somewhere between 3 and 5 miles done. It felt good, you need a shower.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You stare at the literature review section of your article. This is one section that you really need to revise. It is unclear what work you&amp;#8217;ve done, what the gap is, and how you fit in. Come on Michael, you can do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You open Evernote and locate your research notes. First you create a list with the movements of the research. You have questions like &amp;#8220;Why do peer review?&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;Why is it difficult?&amp;#8221; In a list under these you&amp;#8217;ve put names like Barron, Bishop, Bruffee, Trimbur, Mayers, Jung, Yancey, Hesse, and Alexander. You start to see how they relate to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some are grouped around literacy, others the workshop, other gamification, and others still on collaboration. You start to maybe see how they interact, and where you fit it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.michaelhealy.info/2016/05/reading-and-research/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Do more research?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.michaelhealy.info/2016/05/serious-revisions/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Start some serious revisions?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Instead of doing any writing you choose to go back and do more research. You&amp;#8217;ve already read three books in relationship to this article by now. What else do you need? Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hours later, and no further writing on your draft, you have a new stack of articles that seem related. You&amp;#8217;ve also thought about other potentials for revision, peer-review, creative writing, and multimodality that need researching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You decide that you could research forever if you wanted to. You open healy.gwp.draft1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.michaelhealy.info/2016/05/more-revision-narrative/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Return to writing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Whoa, that was a lot of work. I hope that you haven&amp;#8217;t been lost. I&amp;#8217;ve often felt lost as I&amp;#8217;ve explored these areas, memories, and my own process. Now that that&amp;#8217;s out of the way, lets continue back on to adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You rename the document &amp;#8220;healy.gwp.draft1&amp;#8221; and read through your work. There are some decent ideas here. You like what you&amp;#8217;ve done. However, given the reading, there is a big gap in the theory section. In fact, the literature review seems rather thin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you do next?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.michaelhealy.info/2016/05/reading-and-research/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Proceed with more reading and research?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.michaelhealy.info/2016/05/run/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Close the document and go for a run?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You find yourself sitting in a room. There is a computer in front of you playing music. There is a cup of coffee on the desk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You take a drink and start to type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ve been working on a piece that you&amp;#8217;ve titled: &amp;#8220;It’s Dangerous to Go Alone! Take This&amp;#8221;: Co-op Play and the Gamified Workshop.&amp;#8221; It&amp;#8217;s a piece that you&amp;#8217;ve been working on since taking &lt;em&gt;Creative Writing Pedagogy&lt;/em&gt; last fall. This article discusses a gamified workshop pedagogy. You&amp;#8217;ve revised, and rethought it, and revised again. You used it as your writing sample for applying to PhD programs. You&amp;#8217;re trying to get it ready for publication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just recently you&amp;#8217;ve completely overhauled the lit review section, hopefully crafting a theoretical space from which to operate. It seems to have worked, even though it was difficult to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You stand here now, thinking about the process and how it started. Trying to dive into memory to account for the work that you&amp;#8217;ve done to date. A simple accounting: at least 10 named drafts as its moved from the germ of an idea to where it stands now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with you for this adventure are a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.michaelhealy.info/2016/05/cast-of-characters/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Cast of Characters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-has-been-said-already&#34;&gt;What has been said already?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;
    Memory:
  &lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    [aesop_character img=&amp;#8221;http://www.michaelhealy.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/memory.jpg&amp;#8221; align=&amp;#8221;right&amp;#8221; width=&amp;#8221;400px&amp;#8221; force_circle=&amp;#8221;off&amp;#8221;]
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    I would like to start with a number of ideas with memory. The first is to go way back to Augustine and to the idea that memory is a generative force, that “when I speak, the images of all I speak of are present, out of the same treasury of memory; nor would I speak of any thereof, were the images wanting” (Augustine 5). That, as Augustine says &amp;#8220;the art of memory and the art of rhetoric are deeply interdependent&amp;#8221; (Tell 236). That working with memory means creating and playing with stuff. Or, as Lynda Barry asks, &amp;#8220;What is the past made (from) of?&amp;#8221; (19). An as she continues, in order think and create we need to play, and that play isn&amp;#8217;t always fun, but it&amp;#8217;s always generative (51-52).
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    Play with memory is especially generative, because as &amp;#8221; Proust knew: the past is never past. As long as we are alive, our memories remain wonderfully volatile. In their mercurial mirror we see ourselves” (Lehrer 95). The key with play as a generative force is that “memory’s not a stable repository of the past; instead it is reconstructive and creative, dependent on past, present, and future” (Rider 82). And most importantly, memory is not a static thing, it
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      in any case, is always already secondary revision: even the memories we run and rerun inside our heads are residues of physical process, often unconscious ones; and their (re)telling—putting subjective memory-images into some communicable form—always involves ordering and organizing them in one way or another (Kuhn 184).
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    Memory work, as Annette Kuhn discusses, is “an active practice of remembering which takes an inquiring attitude towards the past and the activity of its (re)construction through memory” (Kuhn 186). And with this framing of memory work, it is important to see that to live and write and play with the past is to relive and inhabit it, to live it twice (Hampl 36-7). Using memory in composition and revision is especially important as it asks our students to engage with themselves now and in the past to best communicate.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    This is especially vital for the work of students, to see how their memories are generative and lived experiences. That when they are in the classroom or the world and engaging rhetorically, that they are playing with memory, they are recognizing genres and conventions, they are being asked to play with their memories. And its not always fun, but its important. That when “we teach our students to search, use, and value their own memories when they write, we foster rhetoric that breaks out of the chains of standardized thinking and writing” (Rider 108). Memory becomes an operative and playful force, it lets the generation of thought and interaction function. Memory is vital for the functioning of language and its tempering through revision. Memory studies helps us better understand revision by helping us better understand how we connect to others through memory.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;
    Process:
  &lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    [aesop_character img=&amp;#8221;http://www.michaelhealy.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img_0415-e1462474741733.jpg&amp;#8221; align=&amp;#8221;right&amp;#8221; width=&amp;#8221;400px&amp;#8221; force_circle=&amp;#8221;off&amp;#8221;]
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    Process is hard work. It requires us to engage with ourselves, our writing, and each other repeatably. It takes time and effort. As Donald Murray says, its “the process of using language to learn about our world, to evaluate what we learn about our world, to communicate what we learn about our world” (Murray 4). In composition, the writing process underlies much of what we do, how we teach, and how we see the world. To use language is to act rhetorically, which is to engage with process with the world. In assessing process, we have devised a number of ways to think about and have students think about it. We&amp;#8217;ve thought up methods of assessment and assignment that ask students to engage, again and again, with the writing process, and to “help students see how text and writers and readers are always and inevitably embedded in multiple contexts and cultures” (Tobin 16). We&amp;#8217;ve turned towards reflection, process narratives, and portfolios as ways to help students see and account for the process work that they have done so that “students are provided with an incentive to consider how, why, when, and for whom texts, their own as well as those composed by others, make any kind of meaning at all” (Shipka W355). We&amp;#8217;ve looked at a variety of ways and methods for them to see process and to experience the generative play of memory and revision.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    What seems most vital in the teaching and assessing of process is for students to “speak to the shifting relationships between context and text” (Yancey 22 “Postmodern”) as they are “all oriented to the circulation of texts, to genre, to media, and to the ways that writing gets made, both individually and culturally” (Yancey “Made not only in Words” 315). Using process, portfolios, and careful assessment we can see to “the inclusion of these contexts in our teaching and learning as a kind of palimpsest makes meaning more complex, more sophisticated (if not always more immediately coherent) as it makes it more specific, less anonymous” (Yancey 23 “Postmodern”). Process is a way to help students see the layers and they are put down, iterated on, changed, and adapted. These process practices make sure that “students must attend to the impact of their writerly choices as well as to the visual, material, and technological aspects of their texts and practices” (Shipka W355). If the goal is for students to evolve in their awareness of process and rhetoric, then an inclusion of memory and play at the center of pedagogy appears necessary. Memory offers a way to peal back, account for, assess, and see the layers the process has built up.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;
    Revision:
  &lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    [aesop_character img=&amp;#8221;http://www.michaelhealy.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img_0406.jpg&amp;#8221; align=&amp;#8221;right&amp;#8221; width=&amp;#8221;400px&amp;#8221; force_circle=&amp;#8221;off&amp;#8221;]
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    The most visible piece of process for many students is revision, it is also one of the most difficult for students to engage meaningfully with. This, in many ways, is due to how “we have failed to theorize how readers and writers contend with the inevitable disconnections that permeate their experiences with texts” (Jung 11) as they move through process from writers to readers and back again. For growth in writing, student “writers need to see that logic, imagination, and reason, not obscure rules, motivate everything writers do, every comment teacher and editors make” (Deither 7). They need to make the connections between what they are doing as the author and the feedback of their audience. By having students &amp;#8220;engag[e] in rigorous self-reflection while reading and writing, thinkers become revisers connecting with other revisers and themselves” (Jung 28). If we can make the connections for students between process, revision, and intent, they can start to see how memory can functions and a generative force.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    An important aspect of revision is allowing students to try and fail, and having that be a part of the learning process. They have to be allowed to see how, as Lynda Barry puts it, their thoughts have mass and weight. They need to space to play in order to see how they operate together. To see, &amp;#8220;to admit that memory is not a warehouse of finished stories, not a gallery of framed pictures” (Hampl 26). That memory is a thing to be worked through, like writing, like language, like living. That play and memory have vital functions in revision and process, and that its not always fun, but it is necessary.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;
    Gaming:
  &lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    [aesop_character img=&amp;#8221;http://www.michaelhealy.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img_0261.jpg&amp;#8221; align=&amp;#8221;right&amp;#8221; width=&amp;#8221;400px&amp;#8221; force_circle=&amp;#8221;off&amp;#8221;]
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    Here is where I see gaming and gamification having immense potential in the teaching of rhetoric and composition. As James Paul Gee discusses, good games have learning principle built in, and they let players explore them as they are challenged, fail, learn, and ultimately enjoy the game. Games are a “always actively assembled (or changed) by the player, on the spot, in terms of images, materials, dialogue, and embodied actions in the virtual world being mutually created by the game and the player” (Gee 82). Games exist at an interactive intersection between author and audience, where both have agency in the playing and experience of the game. Games offer a place to think and have students:
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      consider connections &lt;em&gt;across modes of writing and writing environments&lt;/em&gt; cuts to the heart of what we as compositionist &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be doing: offering students a diversity of writing experiences &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; encouraging them to become more &lt;em&gt;conscious&lt;/em&gt; writers—that is, writers rhetorically aware of how audience, genre, and tone work in a variety of writing environments (Alexander 59)
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    Games offer a rich and revisionary memory space. The popularity of nostalgic and history video games shows that “it is this memory of the real that is most valuable to the consumer seeking catharsis through participation in a richly nostalgic simulation” (Sloan 547). Video games offer a way to engage the past, play with it, play in it, and play from it. They offer a rich space from which to have students engage and play with their texts, even if they don&amp;#8217;t realize the are engaged in a gamified pedagogy. The strength of gaming is in its ability to &amp;#8220;demand critical attention in order to understand better how the history of past media bears upon the present&amp;#8221; (Taylor and Whalen 13). Combining memory with gaming the ability to frame and give a broader context that accounts for individuals and their experiences.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    Gaming also gives students the time and space to ask, and see, how the world and the greater context is interacting with themselves. They can produce and examine games to see “the opportunity to engage with their courses in a deep way that encourages mastery over performance” (Aguilar et al 23) and to experience how “even in the most complicated piece of branching logic, entry into each potential branch is, at its core, mediated by a simple test of true/false (that is, Boolean) logic” (Bailey 72). Gaming combine with memory, and the choices evoked, is a rich rhetorical space. Gaming, and gamed environments, allow for students to see and play with memory in a way that other mediums don&amp;#8217;t always allow.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The germ of this idea was connecting revision and memory. How do we teach revision? How might we teach it better? How might working with memory help? I looked to Julie Jung, Jody Shipka, and Kathleen Blake Yancey to see what others have said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve also had a fascination with gamification. I have my own history as a gamer, and specifically a computer gamer, that has informed many of these initial inquiries. So, I went to a few panels at CCCC in 2015 and have since picked up and continued with the idea of using games and gaming within the composition classroom. I&amp;#8217;ve read McAllister, Gee, Alexander, Eyman, and others with the intent of exploring what gaming can tell us about learning, about rhetoric, about composition, and about pedagogy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[aesop_quote type=&amp;#8221;block&amp;#8221; background=&amp;#8221;#58BA50&amp;#8243; text=&amp;#8221;#000000&amp;#8243; width=&amp;#8221;content&amp;#8221; height=&amp;#8221;auto&amp;#8221; align=&amp;#8221;right&amp;#8221; size=&amp;#8221;3&amp;#8243; quote=&amp;#8221;What&amp;#8217;s the gap?&amp;#8221; parallax=&amp;#8221;off&amp;#8221; direction=&amp;#8221;left&amp;#8221;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But where does memory fit within this nexus of revision, composition, gamification, and pedagogy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to teach out of what I know. I like to push my own limits as I expand what is possible for my students. I want to work to expand my own possibilities as I challenge my students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I specifically see gamification as a powerful way of exploring, playing, and accounting for choices that students make in the revision process. Memory is an active meaning maker, used to account for and detail the ways in which their process functioned. Revision is memory work, and accounting for the revision process is a way of explicitly using memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While gamification serves as the inspiration for this project, it will be background theory that informs the pedagogy. I don&amp;#8217;t see gamification playing as overt of a role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want students to be able to create interactive memory texts that explore their revision processes. In this text, students are asked to use memory to account for why they did what they did. They are also tasked with using memory to imagine other possibilities for their text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The context of this interactive revision narrative is a reflective texts for students. How do students use memory in revision? How do they account for the choices they made? How would this memory work help students further engage with deep revision? How does having students engage with the creation of this memory text help them account for process? How does memory inform how revision and process work for students? Is this interactive memory text useful for meta-cognition?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working with memory in crafting revision narratives helps students grow as revisers and learn their writing processes.&lt;/p&gt;
