<p><a href="http://2017compositiontheory.blogspot.com/2017/01/processing-assumptions.html" target="_blank">Blog Post: Processing Assumptions</a>
So far, we have surveyed some of the historical nature of the field and the discipline, we have yet to see the theoretical march and progression through different theories and theoretical stances as they had developed. As I read, I was struck by how many of the same issues, problems, and assumptions have largely stayed the same or are still being wrestled with.</p>

<p>Rohman and Wlecke consider an early form of process pedagogy, where-in pre-writing “writing, as one form of creation, is more usefully though of not as made up of words, but of combinations of words” (224). They seem to be examining, as Jessi pointed out, a gap between what they were seeing and teaching. Their examination of pre-writing, and the underlying assumptions on the nature of the writing process and the underlying ideologies, starts to wrestle with the contextualized and recursive nature of writing and writing process. I found their focus, in the conclusion, that “the primary badness of writing is not incorrect grammar or inelegant express; it is rather a matter of stale perspective, cliché response” (226-7), comes up with the same issues that I have with my students. If they aren’t invested, or at least interested, in what they are writing, it sounds bored, stale, and bad. It also has a rushed and incomplete quality to it (something that I know I am guilty of).</p>

<p>Emig takes this a step further with her interest and study in The Composing Processes of Twelfth Graders. By examining the actual actions that writers, both professional and student, use to compose, a more nuanced cognitive approach to understanding process emerges. Her approach, research questions, methods, and methodologies illuminate much of what students and writers do or may do while writing. For as much as I appreciated her discussion, I found the focusing on the product of writing, even while examining process, disconcerting. This was a hesitation that ultimately Schreiner, Belanoff, and Pradl all present. Emig does a lot of good work, but it does arise out of the assumptions and perspectives of modernist literature and current-traditionalism. It is incredibly interesting, but assumes that good writing is literary writing, and process should help get students to that point.</p>

<p>James Berlin, in his piece, lays out the development of composition as it has developed largely during the 20th century. Berlin sees three major movements in the development of ideological rhetorical basis for composition in cognitive psychology, expressivism, and social-epistemic (668). His essay helped to illuminate the various underlying ideologies that pushed composition in various directions. It was also interesting to see how different pedagogies linked through ideology or reactions to it. It also presented the work of composition, potentially, as being more than just teaching “how to write correctly.” That examining pedagogy and ideology is vitally necessary to teach responsibly.</p>

<p>I think that expressivism is an interesting theory of composing to examine. First, it conceptualizes writing as a combination of overlapping acts, thoughts, ideologies, processes, and products. It gives permission and room for the exploration of writing, in various styles and happenings. Additionally, Peter Elbow, and his more moderate approach in freewriting, offers expressivism as a means to produce the stuff for writing to work from. There is an advantage here in producing composition, and lots of it, in response to stuff. However, expressivism lacks a clear direction and method of assessment, outside of participation (at least from my stance). I see this expressed both by Elbow himself and by Berlin. What works for one does not work for all. It also is just a little too neat, “easy,” and corruptible. It also doesn’t account for the variety of rhetorical situations, ecologies, and actual places where composition is, happens, does work, circulates, and fades away. It seems to be a pile-it-on approach, that if we just write enough then something good is bound to rise to the surface.</p>

<p>Throughout, even with Elbow, I was surprised at how much of the talk focused on the product of writing. While process was overall important, freewriting still had an idea of goal in mind, even if it was personal and metacognitive. But there was an underlying assumption that composition, and composition theory, uses process to get at production of texts, and that these texts can be compared to others.</p>

<h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>

<h3 id="what-is-the-artifact-within-the-larger-context-of-the-course-experience">What is the artifact within the larger context of the course/experience?</h3>

<p>This selection is from the third week of classes, and our second overall blog post. It was situated to examine the development of composition as a discipline of inquiry, and as an important area of study. Within it, we were asked to see how composition had developed as a theoretical inquiry. Additionally, we were asked to examine one specific approach and outline its advantages and limitations. This asked us to start synthesizing multiple weeks together, and to start to see the development of conversations, and the evolution of composition theory over time.</p>

<h3 id="so-what-or-why-was-this-a-meaningful-learning-experience">So what, or why was this a meaningful learning experience?</h3>

<p>This was a meaningful learning experience due to the synthesis of ideas that I was able to encounter. It allowed me to start (re)connecting theories and readings from within the class and from my prior experience. Due to my previous institution and my own interests, I have spent a great deal of time with composition theory and pedagogy, especially with classroom and writing center concerns.  I found that (re)examining this material in this new context allowed me to see connections and ideas that I did not see previously, such as the focus on the products of writing even while discussing process. I was also thinking, though I did not see this at the time, about connections to readings that we have now done, as well as connections to other areas of composition that I have worked with and theorized.</p>

<h3 id="now-what-or-what-do-i-need-to-know-for-the-learning-that-lies-ahead">Now what, or what do I need to know for the learning that lies ahead?</h3>

<p>The next steps are that there is still an incredible amount to learn. I have found that (re)working within this theory has allowed me to make and see connections that I did not prior. It also lets me know that I need to continue to be open to and see these overlaps and evolutions as they happen. I&#8217;ve been making both mental and physical notes more explicit for these connections, and its been interesting to see how they have played out in explicit and implicit ways in my pedagogy. I&#8217;m also finding that I need to continue making connections between composition theory and pedagogy, and rhetorical theory and pedagogy.</p>
