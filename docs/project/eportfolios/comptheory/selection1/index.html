<p>These three pieces detail the historic movements, developments, and changes of composition as an action, pedagogy, theory, class, and concession. Skinnel details the evolution of composition classes at Arizona State as the college developed and changed over its history. Miller detail the development of College English through rhetoric and Belles Lettres in the Scottish system of higher education. Braddock examines the use of topic sentences within popular compositions with an aim at examining the ways in which we teach writing at the paragraph level. And finally, Christensen looks to establish a rhetoric for the paragraph that can be used to illustrate and teach the ways in which paragraphs generate and make meaning. These pieces, in their various ways, detail the content and context of the evolution of composition as a field of study, inquiry, pedagogy, and theory. All four pieces detail the emergence of rhetoric and composition as a “need” to teach in the university for various exigencies and shifting ideologies. Braddock and Christensen use their pieces to critique the pedagogies and approaches that had been inherited in English and composition from earlier traditions.</p>

<p>I found these pieces alternatively interesting and incredibly difficult. I really enjoyed Skinnel’s detailing of the context of the evolution of composition, and how it evolved, and was variously conceded, due to outside influences, cultural changes, and ideological shifts at Arizona State. It was an interesting angle to approach the history, and it was enlightening to see how it arose out of his research, almost unexpectedly. I had difficulty with the Miller piece, especially in trying to keep the pieces straight. I did find the dive into the specific socio-cultural issues of Scottish universities, and the evolution of rhetoric, composition, and the student societies, an interesting historical framing of the tradition that we seem to have inherited, at least in part, within English departments. Both Braddock and Christensen offered an interesting view into concerns at the time, and different ways to look at the paragraph. I see these two as showing growing concern for a growing field in the interests and pedagogies of teachers of composition.</p>

<p>So, what is the historical context for 21<sup>st</sup> century composition in the academy? First, it is one that is situated, largely, within English departments. While Skinnel did detail some exceptions to this, composition and composition studies seems firmly within the scope and purview of English departments on campuses that are largely divided by college, school, and discipline. Additionally, within this context, composition is seen as a skill that needs to be taught and can be mastered with the right practice and pedagogy. Composition is there to serve and provide support for other disciplines, endeavors, and inquiry within other fields, and not necessarily as one of its own. However, there seems to be a large deal of pushback against this assumption, as detailed in all the articles. Composition may have started to meet some exigence, supposed need, or out of an ideological shift, but the work within is vital. There is also the sense, as I see it given these readings, of composition standing at intersections between disciplines, departments, universities, and the public. Composition is more than just a required class or an introduction to academic discourse. These readings summarize that prior, and pedestrian, view of composition and challenge it to be something more. It also details the many institutional and ideological challenges to the study, practice, theory, and pedagogy of composition.</p>

<h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>

<h3 id="what-is-the-artifact-within-the-larger-context-of-the-course-experience">What is the artifact within the larger context of the course/experience?</h3>

<p>This SRR was from the third week of class. This piece, for me, shows the beginnings of my historiographical understandings of the field and discipline. While I have had classes, studied, and used composition theory and pedagogy, I feel that my historical perspectives all were through the march and progression of various pedagogies. I find this artifact interesting in situating myself and my current understandings of composition within a historical context. This selection also allowed me to nerd out a bit over contexts and histories.</p>

<h3 id="so-what-or-why-was-this-a-meaningful-learning-experience">So what, or why was this a meaningful learning experience?</h3>

<p>This was a meaningful learning experience for a number of reasons. The first was that I was able to better situate both the current and historical contexts of composition as a field and as a discipline. This exploration of the writing and histories shows how I am starting to better see and articulate the context from which composition, as we see it now, arose within universities. I also see how it started, stopped, stumbled, and co-evolved in different contexts with different focuses. I am able to perceive the multiplicity of theories and pedagogies more clearly.</p>

<h3 id="now-what-or-what-do-i-need-to-know-or-do-for-the-learning-that-lies-ahead">Now what, or what do I need to know or do for the learning that lies ahead?</h3>

<p>Mostly, that I still have a lot to learn. That composition is situated in complex political, ideological, and historical contexts. That while we have a field and discipline, that the expression &ldquo;on the ground&rdquo; can be quite different based on history and location. There is also a deep history to rhetoric and composition, and there will be additional framing as we study the evolution of composition. I also see that many of the same issues that we are currently dealing with have long histories. It lets me really see that there is already a lot that I know, but that there is also a lot that I still have left to learn about composition.</p>
