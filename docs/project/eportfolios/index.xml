      <description>&lt;p&gt;Coxwell-Teague, Deborah, and Ronald F. Lunsford eds. &lt;em&gt;First-Year Composition: From Theory to Practice&lt;/em&gt;. Parlor Press, Anderson, SC, 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This edited collection provides theoretical background for a hypothetical first-year composition class. Coxwell-Teague and Lunsford ask the contributors&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;ldquo;what they would do if they taught semester-long first-year composition course at their schools and if they knew such courses were to be the only college-level composition course the students would take&amp;rdquo; (preface viii)? Each chapter is separated into two halves: theoretical frame and a syllabus. In the first section of each chapter, the contributors offer the rationales for their design of the course, each highly representative of their own interests and their contexts. The second half of the chapter are supplementary materials, each with a syllabus, and many with assignment sheets. Overall, the collection offers a snapshot of what many scholars in Rhetoric and Composition see as the important features of this class. There are many commonalities among them, where FYC does not focus on grammar, persuasion, or on the &amp;ldquo;improvement of writing&amp;rdquo;. Overall, the collection offers an interesting look at what the core teaching practices and focuses of the discipline are, and where they fit within First-Year composition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This edited collection examines issues of curriculum design, teacher preperation, graduate teaching assistants, labor, pedagogy, and practice.

The provided chapters offer a snapshot into program design, preperation, curriculum, education, support, and local contexts for a variety of teaching assistants, adjuncts, faculty, and professors teaching college writing. The chapters tended to reflect the local nature of the program, outside of some that took a winder stance such as Yancey&amp;rsquo;s heurstic for curriculum design. Overall, the chapters tended to get repetitive, with many offering similar types of programs with various levels teacher preperation and support. There were things to be learned in terms of the framing, content, and ongoing programs that teachers of composition need, and how to structure programs and curriculums. This volume, as compared to the others, was light on theory but had lots of on-the-ground types of insights and explorations&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my Spring 2017 Composition Theory ePortfolio. The links go to the individual components that have been selected for inclusion. The selections here represent some of the work of this semester though is not inclusive. I also intend for these selections and reflections to look back to what I brought into the class, what I learned here, and forward to new contexts. At the bottom of this page are links to and brief descriptions of each artifact collected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall reflection for the ePortfolio will guide you through the reading and connections. As you read through the reflection, the artifacts that I mention will be linked and open in new tabs, so that specifics of what I mention will be available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;final-reflection-reflection&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;reflection&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Final Reflection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This serves as a synthesis of the artifacts collected within this ePortfolio. This reflection works with the themes and readings of the class to illustrate the selections, while also looking beyond the classroom context to how the learning and artifacts function more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;triptych-plus-project-triptych&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;triptych&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Triptych Plus Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project examines three different perspectives on composition: Homebrewing Community, a SpaceX hosted webcast for a rocket launch, and Malea Powell&amp;rsquo;s 2012 CCCCs chairs address. The above link will take you directly to the reflective overlay, which then links to the individual panels of the triptych. This organization mirrors the theological art use of a triptych, with the overall theme opening up to reveal the interior workings, which is present in the &lt;a href=&#34;triptychreflection&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Triptych Plus Reflective Overlay&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;perspective-project-perspectives&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;perspectives&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Perspective Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This link connects to my video interview with Ned Stuckey-French on composition and his composition process. The video essay, based around the recorded interview is featured, along with an additional reflection and provided links on the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;below-are-three-selections-with-reflections-from-the-class-this-semester&#34;&gt;Below are three selections, with reflections, from the class this semester.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This selection is an SRR that examines the history and evolution of composition in universities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;selection-two-and-reflection-processing-assumptions-selection2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;selection2&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Selection Two and Reflection: Processing Assumptions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a blog post that takes a different perspective on the development of composition as a discipline based on the research being done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This SRR examines the history and taxonomies of different WAC/WID programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an assignment prompt from my 2135 class that I&amp;rsquo;m teaching this semester. I chose this because of the pedagogical connections between composition theory and what I am teaching. I also chose it because the prompt and activity was influenced by work in collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;look-at-all-this-stuff-on-playing-printing-and-virtual-reality-in-the-digital-humanities-https-digitalscholars-wordpress-com-2017-02-12-look-at-all-this-stuff-on-playing-printing-and-virtual-reality-in-the-digital-humanities&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://digitalscholars.wordpress.com/2017/02/12/look-at-all-this-stuff-on-playing-printing-and-virtual-reality-in-the-digital-humanities/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Look at all this Stuff! On Playing, Printing, and Virtual Reality in the Digital Humanities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a blog post that I composed as an introduction to a digital scholars meeting. This was a synthesis of the readings and materials for the week, and was situated within a very specific rhetorical ecology and responded to a set of exigencies. I also chose it due to the content of the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;final-project-abstract-abstract&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;abstract&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Final Project Abstract&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This connects to my final project abstract, which involves a short study from my teaching this semester that looks at play, voice, and pedagogy, and seeks to study the efficacy of play in students use of voice in 2135. I am targeting SAMLA for the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Final Project Abstract</title>
      <link>http://michaelhealy.space/academic/project/eportfolios/comptheory/abstract/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 16 Apr 2017 22:20:18 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://michaelhealy.space/academic/project/eportfolios/comptheory/abstract/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For my final project I am proposing a conference concurrent-session presentation that uses research from my classroom this semester. I am studying the efficacy of play as an organizational and pedagogical theory in ENC 2135. I am interested in students; perceptions on play within the composition classroom, especially in the development of voice and agency in their writing. I have anecdotally seen it as a positive influence through my teaching, but I want something more empirical that I can build from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do the study I have prepared a materials release form and a short survey to distribute to students. I have arranged for the distribution and collection of these materials. I will use these responses, student reflections, and student evaluations to read and code for play, voice, and agency. I will be focusing on a peer review exercise that has students speed date a draft, a collaborative activity that asks students to inhabit inquiry, and the semester reflection letter for their ePortfolios. I will develop a coding scheme (at this point I&amp;rsquo;m unsure if it will be deductive or inductive) to examine the written materials. I will use the coding, surveys, and my own observations to help triangulate the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to see first, what students think about a play infused classroom through these activities, and second, to see if there is evidence of efficacy within their reflective writings, evaluations, and surveys. I am developing a conference proposal based on this study for SAMLA, with two potential panels of interest: &lt;em&gt;Voices From The Twenty-First-Century College Composition Classroom&lt;/em&gt; Or &lt;em&gt;Critical Thinking In The Rhet-Comp Classroom&lt;/em&gt; I see this resonating with either of these panels, but I am also willing to submit through the general call for papers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Intellectual Whack-a-Mole</title>
      <link>http://michaelhealy.space/academic/project/eportfolios/comptheory/triptychreflection/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 15 Apr 2017 17:21:47 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://michaelhealy.space/academic/project/eportfolios/comptheory/triptychreflection/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In looking back through my exploration of &lt;a href=&#34;http://michaelhealy.space/academic/project/eportfolios/comptheory/triptych#hombrewing&#34;&gt;homebrewing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://michaelhealy.space/academic/project/eportfolios/comptheory//triptych#spacex&#34;&gt;a SpaceX webcast&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://michaelhealy.space/academic/project/eportfolios/comptheory/triptych#powell&#34;&gt;Malea Powell‚Äôs CCCCs address&lt;/a&gt;, I see trends coalesce around the social nature of composing and composition. The different composing practices and compositions of these three artifacts are all situated in-between multiple voices, knowledges, places, spaces, and practices. Composition, from looking at these three pieces of the triptych, assembles into a communal inscription by a person or persons onto the world, with some specific and rhetorical aim to the process. All three illustrate the aspects of ecologies in which compositions, writers, audiences, process, and literacies circulate within and between each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing that I noticed was how highly contextual composition is. Examining the homebrewing community provided a range of different and situated composing practices as potential examples‚Äîtroubleshooting a brew, sharing knowledge, sharing brewing stories, developing a recipe, or brewing itself‚Äîthat are all related to the same basic activity and have a similar knowledge foundation, but require potentially different responses. The SpaceX hosted webcast was also highly contextual, with the focus on the composition being the events of the launch, the customer, an experimental rocket landing, and the return to flight after an accident investigation. Malea Powell‚Äôs address was situated within the context of CCCCs, but also with an audience of educators and composition professionals. The talk was also situated within the context of St. Louis and the stories related to place, people, and erasure that were assembled in the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, composition is used to express and share the knowledge and expertise of a community of practice. In the homebrew beer community, composition practices are used to disseminate and share best practices, scientific insights, personal experiences, and in the assemblage of ingredients for recipes. Composition in used to communicate between members and initiates of the community on how to brew beer and the effects of different approaches, where the assemblage of ingredients, methods, time, people, and temperature, all have effects on the end-product. The SpaceX hosted webcast had as a purpose the sharing of knowledge and expertise through a variety of professionals, data, and images to share what was events during the launch coverage, and was presented in a way to be interesting to experts and to novices. And lastly, Malea Powell‚Äôs address was an assemblage of voices and important issues that she felt needed to be presented and addressed. She drew on a plurality of voices to showcase a depth of knowledge in an issue for a knowledgeable community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, composition and composing can be used to learn, explore, and express interest or membership within different communities. It can also be used to exclude others from that community. I found this aspect most apparent in Malea Powell‚Äôs talk where compositions can be a means through which hegemonic power expresses itself. It can be used to welcome and initiate communication between people and communities, but it can also be used as a means to erase, as with the Cahokia. Composition and composing are epistemological, and their use by different communities can give voice and impose silence. These practices were less obvious, as they weren‚Äôt explicitly explored, in my other two artifacts. However, the SpaceX webcast has the issue of welcoming people in, they needed to have the technological access and knowledge about the launch to find and engage with the community. The webcast itself is set up with multiple voices, angles, illustrations, and perspectives to serve as both a learning and advertising tool. Lastly, the homebrewing community uses composition to experiment and communicate. It can be interesting, as I‚Äôm doing right now, to play around with the constituent ingredients for a beer recipe to see what happens. This sense of play with the constituent piece of a composition appeared to be an important aspect of the community. Using other compositions, like community forums and websites, allows for a means of entry for interested people, though they can also be exclusionary in the expertise, vocabulary, and knowledge needed to approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, that composition is a process, with many voices and influences behind a composer, that may or may not be visible or expressed. All three of the artifacts and situations that I examined were explicitly communal, multi-authored, and multi-voiced. While not something that I particularly sought out, I was surprised at how overtly communal composition and composing can be. Malea Powell demonstrated this in her talk by assembling and negotiating between multiple voices and perspectives. It was also visually clear within the SpaceX webcast that there were multiple people, events, and compositions assembled together, with a variety of purposes, in the one webcast screen. And the homebrewing community is one that seems to show their collective interest in most things that they do. Recipes and experiments are composed collectively, with people drawing clearly on prior knowledge and precedent. There is also the critique and evaluation within the community of beer that has been brewed, with discussions on how best to adapt or develop new approaches within the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fifth, that composition is rhetorical. This was an assumption of mine coming into the project, but I think it is worth exploring. Each of these artifacts had a clear rhetorical nature. All of the communities and compositions responded to some exigence, had an audience in mind, appealed to that audience, and hoped to influence them in some way. Malea Powell was very clearly addressing the audience at CCCCs and within the field. She wanted to bring attention to invisible issues of colonialism and to offer a space for different epistemologies. For SpaceX, there was the occasion of a rocket launch, but it was also their first flight back after an accident in September. This webcast was also composed for multiple audience that may or may not have similar reasons for watching, and they did their best to address those. The homebrewing community responds to and composes within the rhetorical situation of the hobby, with a variety of responses by and for different audiences based on the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, composition is ecological in that it responds to, circulates, and evolves based on highly situated and interwoven processes, audiences, materials, and composers. Composing and composition exist within a variety of forces and situations, and it operates within those bounds. Compositions also evolve as they respond to and adapt for different situations. There also appears to be an intersection between organic responses and directed responses in how the ecology shapes composition and how compositions in turn shape future responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many ways, I found that this project extended or illuminated different aspects of composition and composition theory for me. However, as I was working through it, and the reflection especially, I kept feeling like I was playing Whack-A-Mole. I would have an idea, or a connection, and I would run towards it only to have another one pop up that I wanted to respond to. It was frustrating at times because I didn‚Äôt feel that I was able to dwell in one place or in one thought very long, and that I would shuffle off to the next. There are two things that this project primarily helped to illustrate to me, first, that composition and composing practices are socially situated and that they operate in rhetorical ecologies. These were both connections that I feel I have worked with before, but seeing them play out in a variety of contexts and practices here was really interesting. The process of examining composition and composing through these lenses offered a new, combined perspective that highlighted connections and centered social ecologies within composing for me.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <link>http://michaelhealy.space/academic/project/gamed_peer_review/2016-05-09-conclusions/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2016 06:23:04 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://michaelhealy.space/academic/project/gamed_peer_review/2016-05-09-conclusions/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is an idea that is relatively new, but I think there is great promise in it. Working through the process of performing the revision narrative has been an interesting one. Its one that I knew wouldn&amp;#8217;t be easy, but has also proven to be more difficult than I had at first imagined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[aesop_character img=&amp;#8221;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.michaelhealy.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img_0415-e1462474741733.jpg&amp;amp;#8221&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;http://www.michaelhealy.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img_0415-e1462474741733.jpg&amp;amp;#8221&lt;/a&gt;; name=&amp;#8221;Process&amp;#8221; align=&amp;#8221;left&amp;#8221; width=&amp;#8221;40%&amp;#8221; force_circle=&amp;#8221;off&amp;#8221;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing has been purely logistical. In performing this on my WordPress site, I have had flexibility to move and connect things as I would like, to relate posts together through smart linking and decision trees.But I have found that the accounting requirements to keep track of the links and related elements difficult. I will need to develop a workflow to troubleshoot for students. There will need to be a certain amount of teaching the technology necessary in implementation. I think that it could be done in a similar hypertext, especially with the digital and multimodal affordances of WordPress as a platform, but there will need to be necessary development work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[aesop_character img=&amp;#8221;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.michaelhealy.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/memory.jpg&amp;amp;#8221&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;http://www.michaelhealy.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/memory.jpg&amp;amp;#8221&lt;/a&gt;; name=&amp;#8221;Memory&amp;#8221; align=&amp;#8221;left&amp;#8221; width=&amp;#8221;40%&amp;#8221; force_circle=&amp;#8221;off&amp;#8221;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found the work with memory really surprising. I was fully expecting to find some interesting tidbits in my process. I&amp;#8217;ve always found that reflective and process texts very useful and enlightening. I wasn&amp;#8217;t expecting the level of play with my process to give me as much as it would, especially in considering what else I did while writing. There are other things that I could have accounted for in the text, from placement, to music, to equipment, to the choices that I make at different points related to my writing. When I work on paper, when I turn to a computer, the back-and-forth through research and writing and back again. I have always found my process iterative, going back through data and writing again and again, but I wasn&amp;#8217;t expecting the interplay with my process and memory in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[aesop_character img=&amp;#8221;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.michaelhealy.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img_0406.jpg&amp;amp;#8221&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;http://www.michaelhealy.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img_0406.jpg&amp;amp;#8221&lt;/a&gt;; name=&amp;#8221;Revision&amp;#8221; align=&amp;#8221;left&amp;#8221; width=&amp;#8221;33%&amp;#8221; force_circle=&amp;#8221;off&amp;#8221;]&lt;/p&gt;

  I did find that I was doing a fair amount of revision in the production of this text, especially in terms of how I was utilizing memory. In explicitly invoking and playing with memory, I found that I was often moving between paper notes, Evernote, word documents, and my WordPress site here. This interplay of memories and materials was important. This is really indicative of how memory is a generative force, and revision is a generative force, and how revision is a fully embodied process.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[aesop_character img=&amp;#8221;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.michaelhealy.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img_0261.jpg&amp;amp;#8221&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;http://www.michaelhealy.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img_0261.jpg&amp;amp;#8221&lt;/a&gt;; name=&amp;#8221;Play&amp;#8221; align=&amp;#8221;left&amp;#8221; width=&amp;#8221;33%&amp;#8221; force_circle=&amp;#8221;off&amp;#8221;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&#34;ui-id-3&#34;&gt;
  I found the ideas of play and gaming central to this work. This type of interactive process narrative asks for students to try, fail, revise, learn, and generate knowledge about themselves and how they think and write. The idea that play is important, though not always fun, and the permission to fail productively, was key to this idea and exploration of process and revision. The gamification, the idea of choices, and making evident the various choices was really important. In revisions of this idea, being able to better account for various choices, and having more time to think about and work through them, will be useful.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an approach that will continue to need to be revised and worked with. I think that&amp;#8217;s what is so exciting about this, is that it wants to continue to be played with. I don&amp;#8217;t know how students will react to this, but I think that it could be a really productive, different, and generative way for them to engage with writing. I think this is especially true in the ways that they are asked to utilize memory as a generative force.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You open up healy.gwp.draft2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    [aesop_character img=&amp;#8221;http://www.michaelhealy.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img_0406.jpg&amp;#8221; name=&amp;#8221;Revision&amp;#8221; align=&amp;#8221;center&amp;#8221; width=&amp;#8221;100%&amp;#8221; force_circle=&amp;#8221;off&amp;#8221;]
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s time to get serious with this article! There are a number of reasons for your wanting to do this. First, you really like this idea, think it has great potential, works with your interests, and you&amp;#8217;ve had some luck using it in your own classrooms. In fact, this semester the workshop quest seemed to work really well for a number of your students, with them starting to better see the connections between peer-review and their work, both as readers and as writers. But this stuff is hard, and you&amp;#8217;re struggling with entering into this new discourse. Some of it is time and timing, you&amp;#8217;ve not been at this very long, there is also the part that it is just plain difficult, and you don&amp;#8217;t always get it quite yet. But you&amp;#8217;re trying to make a rhetorically effective document, one that appeals to your audience of other writing teachers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You work on bringing together your research, your position, your findings, and your ideas. You type away, bring parts in from your literature review document, integrating them, seeing how the ideas mesh. You continue to work on the article until there is not much left to do, at least not at this point in time, at least not until you can give your process and memory more time to work it over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things go well with the article. You revise and integrate until you turn it in to *hopefully* complete your independent study. You are proud of what you put together, but also realize that there is a lot of work left to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s been really interesting going back through your process in creating this narrative. There are some places where you see potentials for improvement, for re-seeing your process. There are some shortcomings, but you like where its gotten you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Serious Revisions</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You stare at the open document. You&amp;#8217;ve pulled together quotes and research notes. The weight of doing the revisions in situ seem overwhelming. You open a new document, title it Literature Review, and start typing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You start with the major moves that you&amp;#8217;ve seen in connecting to your own work. You create a set of bullet points that lay out your thoughts and the themes you see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Process and Revision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Peer-Review and Troubles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Workshop as a collaborative and process space&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multimodality/Literacy/Connections between Peer-Review, Workshop, Gaming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gamification as a Method of Connecting Process, Peer-Review, and Collaboration in the Workshop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;#8217;ve laid it out and see the major moves, you start typing away. You integrate quotes, paraphrase, summarize, cut, paste, expand, and bridge. You feel like you&amp;#8217;ve started to create and carve out your own space. It doesn&amp;#8217;t feel quite right yet though. You keep working on it, pushing and pulling. Revising and seeing where it goes. You work on it until it spans almost 5 pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now its time to integrate it back into the rest of the work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.michaelhealy.info/2016/05/integration/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Work on integrating the Literature Review into your main body?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.michaelhealy.info/2016/05/run/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Go for run?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Gamed Process Narrative</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Within this particular pedagogy students are asked to go back through their writing process and to create an interactive revision text. This is set up as a way for students to think about and play with memory. It is a way for them to engage with their writing in their memory as they account for how it came into being. There are a few pieces of this assignment that seem important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first is to address the audience as a player, as someone actively working through the revision process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It should account for a number of the major steps and choices that students made in writing and revision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It should account for alternatives, or paths not taken.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It should allow for interaction by and from the audience and they play with and through the text.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, I would like to attempt an interactive revision text of my own. I am accounting for the process of writing and revision an article length piece that deals with gamification and the workshop (notice a theme).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this I have gone through my memory to work through and account for my own revision process. This has also been necessarily informed by this project and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.michaelhealy.info/2016/05/more-revision-narrative/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Time to start the narrative.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The ones you just got last week. The ones that feel good in the way that only new shoes can. You head out into the neighborhood, your work on the tip of your mind. You click your watch to record the miles and head out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You return home after about a 30-45 minutes, somewhere between 3 and 5 miles done. It felt good, you need a shower.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You stare at the literature review section of your article. This is one section that you really need to revise. It is unclear what work you&amp;#8217;ve done, what the gap is, and how you fit in. Come on Michael, you can do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You open Evernote and locate your research notes. First you create a list with the movements of the research. You have questions like &amp;#8220;Why do peer review?&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;Why is it difficult?&amp;#8221; In a list under these you&amp;#8217;ve put names like Barron, Bishop, Bruffee, Trimbur, Mayers, Jung, Yancey, Hesse, and Alexander. You start to see how they relate to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some are grouped around literacy, others the workshop, other gamification, and others still on collaboration. You start to maybe see how they interact, and where you fit it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.michaelhealy.info/2016/05/reading-and-research/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Do more research?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.michaelhealy.info/2016/05/serious-revisions/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Start some serious revisions?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Instead of doing any writing you choose to go back and do more research. You&amp;#8217;ve already read three books in relationship to this article by now. What else do you need? Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hours later, and no further writing on your draft, you have a new stack of articles that seem related. You&amp;#8217;ve also thought about other potentials for revision, peer-review, creative writing, and multimodality that need researching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You decide that you could research forever if you wanted to. You open healy.gwp.draft1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.michaelhealy.info/2016/05/more-revision-narrative/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Return to writing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Whoa, that was a lot of work. I hope that you haven&amp;#8217;t been lost. I&amp;#8217;ve often felt lost as I&amp;#8217;ve explored these areas, memories, and my own process. Now that that&amp;#8217;s out of the way, lets continue back on to adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You rename the document &amp;#8220;healy.gwp.draft1&amp;#8221; and read through your work. There are some decent ideas here. You like what you&amp;#8217;ve done. However, given the reading, there is a big gap in the theory section. In fact, the literature review seems rather thin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you do next?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.michaelhealy.info/2016/05/reading-and-research/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Proceed with more reading and research?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.michaelhealy.info/2016/05/revise-literature-review/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Revise the literature review section?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.michaelhealy.info/2016/05/run/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Close the document and go for a run?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You find yourself sitting in a room. There is a computer in front of you playing music. There is a cup of coffee on the desk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You take a drink and start to type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ve been working on a piece that you&amp;#8217;ve titled: &amp;#8220;It‚Äôs Dangerous to Go Alone! Take This&amp;#8221;: Co-op Play and the Gamified Workshop.&amp;#8221; It&amp;#8217;s a piece that you&amp;#8217;ve been working on since taking &lt;em&gt;Creative Writing Pedagogy&lt;/em&gt; last fall. This article discusses a gamified workshop pedagogy. You&amp;#8217;ve revised, and rethought it, and revised again. You used it as your writing sample for applying to PhD programs. You&amp;#8217;re trying to get it ready for publication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just recently you&amp;#8217;ve completely overhauled the lit review section, hopefully crafting a theoretical space from which to operate. It seems to have worked, even though it was difficult to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You stand here now, thinking about the process and how it started. Trying to dive into memory to account for the work that you&amp;#8217;ve done to date. A simple accounting: at least 10 named drafts as its moved from the germ of an idea to where it stands now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with you for this adventure are a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.michaelhealy.info/2016/05/cast-of-characters/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Cast of Characters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
