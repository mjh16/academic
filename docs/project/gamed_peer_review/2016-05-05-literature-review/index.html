  <h2>
    Memory:
  </h2>

  <p>
    [aesop_character img=&#8221;http://www.michaelhealy.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/memory.jpg&#8221; align=&#8221;right&#8221; width=&#8221;400px&#8221; force_circle=&#8221;off&#8221;]
  </p>

  <p>
    I would like to start with a number of ideas with memory. The first is to go way back to Augustine and to the idea that memory is a generative force, that “when I speak, the images of all I speak of are present, out of the same treasury of memory; nor would I speak of any thereof, were the images wanting” (Augustine 5). That, as Augustine says &#8220;the art of memory and the art of rhetoric are deeply interdependent&#8221; (Tell 236). That working with memory means creating and playing with stuff. Or, as Lynda Barry asks, &#8220;What is the past made (from) of?&#8221; (19). An as she continues, in order think and create we need to play, and that play isn&#8217;t always fun, but it&#8217;s always generative (51-52).
  </p>

  <p>
    Play with memory is especially generative, because as &#8221; Proust knew: the past is never past. As long as we are alive, our memories remain wonderfully volatile. In their mercurial mirror we see ourselves” (Lehrer 95). The key with play as a generative force is that “memory’s not a stable repository of the past; instead it is reconstructive and creative, dependent on past, present, and future” (Rider 82). And most importantly, memory is not a static thing, it
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      in any case, is always already secondary revision: even the memories we run and rerun inside our heads are residues of physical process, often unconscious ones; and their (re)telling—putting subjective memory-images into some communicable form—always involves ordering and organizing them in one way or another (Kuhn 184).
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Memory work, as Annette Kuhn discusses, is “an active practice of remembering which takes an inquiring attitude towards the past and the activity of its (re)construction through memory” (Kuhn 186). And with this framing of memory work, it is important to see that to live and write and play with the past is to relive and inhabit it, to live it twice (Hampl 36-7). Using memory in composition and revision is especially important as it asks our students to engage with themselves now and in the past to best communicate.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is especially vital for the work of students, to see how their memories are generative and lived experiences. That when they are in the classroom or the world and engaging rhetorically, that they are playing with memory, they are recognizing genres and conventions, they are being asked to play with their memories. And its not always fun, but its important. That when “we teach our students to search, use, and value their own memories when they write, we foster rhetoric that breaks out of the chains of standardized thinking and writing” (Rider 108). Memory becomes an operative and playful force, it lets the generation of thought and interaction function. Memory is vital for the functioning of language and its tempering through revision. Memory studies helps us better understand revision by helping us better understand how we connect to others through memory.

  <h2>
    Process:
  </h2>

  <p>
    [aesop_character img=&#8221;http://www.michaelhealy.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img_0415-e1462474741733.jpg&#8221; align=&#8221;right&#8221; width=&#8221;400px&#8221; force_circle=&#8221;off&#8221;]
  </p>

  <p>
    Process is hard work. It requires us to engage with ourselves, our writing, and each other repeatably. It takes time and effort. As Donald Murray says, its “the process of using language to learn about our world, to evaluate what we learn about our world, to communicate what we learn about our world” (Murray 4). In composition, the writing process underlies much of what we do, how we teach, and how we see the world. To use language is to act rhetorically, which is to engage with process with the world. In assessing process, we have devised a number of ways to think about and have students think about it. We&#8217;ve thought up methods of assessment and assignment that ask students to engage, again and again, with the writing process, and to “help students see how text and writers and readers are always and inevitably embedded in multiple contexts and cultures” (Tobin 16). We&#8217;ve turned towards reflection, process narratives, and portfolios as ways to help students see and account for the process work that they have done so that “students are provided with an incentive to consider how, why, when, and for whom texts, their own as well as those composed by others, make any kind of meaning at all” (Shipka W355). We&#8217;ve looked at a variety of ways and methods for them to see process and to experience the generative play of memory and revision.
  </p>

  <p>
    What seems most vital in the teaching and assessing of process is for students to “speak to the shifting relationships between context and text” (Yancey 22 “Postmodern”) as they are “all oriented to the circulation of texts, to genre, to media, and to the ways that writing gets made, both individually and culturally” (Yancey “Made not only in Words” 315). Using process, portfolios, and careful assessment we can see to “the inclusion of these contexts in our teaching and learning as a kind of palimpsest makes meaning more complex, more sophisticated (if not always more immediately coherent) as it makes it more specific, less anonymous” (Yancey 23 “Postmodern”). Process is a way to help students see the layers and they are put down, iterated on, changed, and adapted. These process practices make sure that “students must attend to the impact of their writerly choices as well as to the visual, material, and technological aspects of their texts and practices” (Shipka W355). If the goal is for students to evolve in their awareness of process and rhetoric, then an inclusion of memory and play at the center of pedagogy appears necessary. Memory offers a way to peal back, account for, assess, and see the layers the process has built up.

  <h2>
    Revision:
  </h2>

  <p>
    [aesop_character img=&#8221;http://www.michaelhealy.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img_0406.jpg&#8221; align=&#8221;right&#8221; width=&#8221;400px&#8221; force_circle=&#8221;off&#8221;]
  </p>

  <p>
    The most visible piece of process for many students is revision, it is also one of the most difficult for students to engage meaningfully with. This, in many ways, is due to how “we have failed to theorize how readers and writers contend with the inevitable disconnections that permeate their experiences with texts” (Jung 11) as they move through process from writers to readers and back again. For growth in writing, student “writers need to see that logic, imagination, and reason, not obscure rules, motivate everything writers do, every comment teacher and editors make” (Deither 7). They need to make the connections between what they are doing as the author and the feedback of their audience. By having students &#8220;engag[e] in rigorous self-reflection while reading and writing, thinkers become revisers connecting with other revisers and themselves” (Jung 28). If we can make the connections for students between process, revision, and intent, they can start to see how memory can functions and a generative force.
  </p>

  <p>
    An important aspect of revision is allowing students to try and fail, and having that be a part of the learning process. They have to be allowed to see how, as Lynda Barry puts it, their thoughts have mass and weight. They need to space to play in order to see how they operate together. To see, &#8220;to admit that memory is not a warehouse of finished stories, not a gallery of framed pictures” (Hampl 26). That memory is a thing to be worked through, like writing, like language, like living. That play and memory have vital functions in revision and process, and that its not always fun, but it is necessary.

  <h2>
    Gaming:
  </h2>

  <p>
    [aesop_character img=&#8221;http://www.michaelhealy.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img_0261.jpg&#8221; align=&#8221;right&#8221; width=&#8221;400px&#8221; force_circle=&#8221;off&#8221;]
  </p>

  <p>
    Here is where I see gaming and gamification having immense potential in the teaching of rhetoric and composition. As James Paul Gee discusses, good games have learning principle built in, and they let players explore them as they are challenged, fail, learn, and ultimately enjoy the game. Games are a “always actively assembled (or changed) by the player, on the spot, in terms of images, materials, dialogue, and embodied actions in the virtual world being mutually created by the game and the player” (Gee 82). Games exist at an interactive intersection between author and audience, where both have agency in the playing and experience of the game. Games offer a place to think and have students:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      consider connections <em>across modes of writing and writing environments</em> cuts to the heart of what we as compositionist <em>should</em> be doing: offering students a diversity of writing experiences <em>and</em> encouraging them to become more <em>conscious</em> writers—that is, writers rhetorically aware of how audience, genre, and tone work in a variety of writing environments (Alexander 59)
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Games offer a rich and revisionary memory space. The popularity of nostalgic and history video games shows that “it is this memory of the real that is most valuable to the consumer seeking catharsis through participation in a richly nostalgic simulation” (Sloan 547). Video games offer a way to engage the past, play with it, play in it, and play from it. They offer a rich space from which to have students engage and play with their texts, even if they don&#8217;t realize the are engaged in a gamified pedagogy. The strength of gaming is in its ability to &#8220;demand critical attention in order to understand better how the history of past media bears upon the present&#8221; (Taylor and Whalen 13). Combining memory with gaming the ability to frame and give a broader context that accounts for individuals and their experiences.
  </p>

  <p>
    Gaming also gives students the time and space to ask, and see, how the world and the greater context is interacting with themselves. They can produce and examine games to see “the opportunity to engage with their courses in a deep way that encourages mastery over performance” (Aguilar et al 23) and to experience how “even in the most complicated piece of branching logic, entry into each potential branch is, at its core, mediated by a simple test of true/false (that is, Boolean) logic” (Bailey 72). Gaming combine with memory, and the choices evoked, is a rich rhetorical space. Gaming, and gamed environments, allow for students to see and play with memory in a way that other mediums don&#8217;t always allow.
