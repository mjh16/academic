      <p>This is an idea that is relatively new, but I think there is great promise in it. Working through the process of performing the revision narrative has been an interesting one. Its one that I knew wouldn&#8217;t be easy, but has also proven to be more difficult than I had at first imagined.</p>

<p>[aesop_character img=&#8221;<a href="http://www.michaelhealy.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img_0415-e1462474741733.jpg&amp;#8221" target="_blank">http://www.michaelhealy.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img_0415-e1462474741733.jpg&amp;#8221</a>; name=&#8221;Process&#8221; align=&#8221;left&#8221; width=&#8221;40%&#8221; force_circle=&#8221;off&#8221;]</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first thing has been purely logistical. In performing this on my WordPress site, I have had flexibility to move and connect things as I would like, to relate posts together through smart linking and decision trees.But I have found that the accounting requirements to keep track of the links and related elements difficult. I will need to develop a workflow to troubleshoot for students. There will need to be a certain amount of teaching the technology necessary in implementation. I think that it could be done in a similar hypertext, especially with the digital and multimodal affordances of WordPress as a platform, but there will need to be necessary development work.</p>

<p>[aesop_character img=&#8221;<a href="http://www.michaelhealy.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/memory.jpg&amp;#8221" target="_blank">http://www.michaelhealy.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/memory.jpg&amp;#8221</a>; name=&#8221;Memory&#8221; align=&#8221;left&#8221; width=&#8221;40%&#8221; force_circle=&#8221;off&#8221;]</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I found the work with memory really surprising. I was fully expecting to find some interesting tidbits in my process. I&#8217;ve always found that reflective and process texts very useful and enlightening. I wasn&#8217;t expecting the level of play with my process to give me as much as it would, especially in considering what else I did while writing. There are other things that I could have accounted for in the text, from placement, to music, to equipment, to the choices that I make at different points related to my writing. When I work on paper, when I turn to a computer, the back-and-forth through research and writing and back again. I have always found my process iterative, going back through data and writing again and again, but I wasn&#8217;t expecting the interplay with my process and memory in the same way.</p>

<p>[aesop_character img=&#8221;<a href="http://www.michaelhealy.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img_0406.jpg&amp;#8221" target="_blank">http://www.michaelhealy.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img_0406.jpg&amp;#8221</a>; name=&#8221;Revision&#8221; align=&#8221;left&#8221; width=&#8221;33%&#8221; force_circle=&#8221;off&#8221;]</p>

<p id="ui-id-2">
  I did find that I was doing a fair amount of revision in the production of this text, especially in terms of how I was utilizing memory. In explicitly invoking and playing with memory, I found that I was often moving between paper notes, Evernote, word documents, and my WordPress site here. This interplay of memories and materials was important. This is really indicative of how memory is a generative force, and revision is a generative force, and how revision is a fully embodied process.
</p>

<p>[aesop_character img=&#8221;<a href="http://www.michaelhealy.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img_0261.jpg&amp;#8221" target="_blank">http://www.michaelhealy.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img_0261.jpg&amp;#8221</a>; name=&#8221;Play&#8221; align=&#8221;left&#8221; width=&#8221;33%&#8221; force_circle=&#8221;off&#8221;]</p>

<p id="ui-id-3">
  I found the ideas of play and gaming central to this work. This type of interactive process narrative asks for students to try, fail, revise, learn, and generate knowledge about themselves and how they think and write. The idea that play is important, though not always fun, and the permission to fail productively, was key to this idea and exploration of process and revision. The gamification, the idea of choices, and making evident the various choices was really important. In revisions of this idea, being able to better account for various choices, and having more time to think about and work through them, will be useful.
</p>

<p>This is an approach that will continue to need to be revised and worked with. I think that&#8217;s what is so exciting about this, is that it wants to continue to be played with. I don&#8217;t know how students will react to this, but I think that it could be a really productive, different, and generative way for them to engage with writing. I think this is especially true in the ways that they are asked to utilize memory as a generative force.</p>
