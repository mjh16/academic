      <title>At Play with Composition: Explorations of Voice</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am studying the efficacy of play as an organizational and pedagogical theory in ENC 2135. I am interested in students’ perceptions on play within the composition classroom, especially in the development of voice and agency in their writing. I have anecdotally seen it as a positive influence through my teaching, but I want something more empirical that I can build from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do the study I have prepared a material’s release form and a short survey to distribute to students. I have arranged for the distribution and collection of these materials. I will use these responses, student reflections, and student evaluations to read and code for play, voice, and agency. I will be focusing on a peer review exercise that has students speed date a draft, a collaborative activity that asks students to inhabit inquiry, and the semester reflection letter for their ePortfolios. I will develop a coding scheme (at this point I’m unsure if it will be deductive or inductive) to examine the written materials. I will use the coding, surveys, and my own observations to help triangulate the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to see first, what students think about a play infused classroom through these activities, and second, to see if there is evidence of efficacy within their reflective writings, evaluations, and surveys. I will be analyzing data over the summer. My intentions with the data analysis and presentation is to offer a way of developing voice in the composition classroom as a strategy that students can utilize.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ludic Revision: Potential, Play, and Choice</title>
      <link>http://michaelhealy.space/academic/talk/cccc2017/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In examining intersections between creative writing and composition, revision stands out as “a space in which we teach students that they have choices” (Leahy and Dechow) as they “engag[e] in rigorous self-refection while reading and writing” (Jung). By further framing this revision as play, or ludic revision, we can help students envision the potential of their writing. Ludic revision is collaborative play with language, and it allows students to productively fail as they work through rhetorical choices in the revision process. It also frames revision as a productive activity that students move through. It asks that they change language in their drafts while addressing rhetorical needs and concerns, in order to more effectively engage with the audience. Revision is a process that connects audience expectations and authors’ intentions, and by framing revision as play, while not always fun, students are provided the time and space to fail productively with language through the consideration of rhetorical choices. In order to foster ludic revision, I establish “play-days” as low stakes activities within the composition classroom. These allow students to play with published writing and their own drafts as they identify audiences, play with language, and make connections to rhetorical choices. They are asked to see how playing with language, on the sentence and craft level, is a rhetorical choice that addresses audience aesthetics and rhetorical concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
