      <description>After a presentation and conversation with Alex Gil, I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen, as a summer project, to re-do my personal website, for a few reasons:
 To better know the technologies I use. To better, and more openly, represent my work. To have more control over my making. I would like to know where the things I&amp;rsquo;m doing are going. To get off of a self-hosted Wordpress site.  These is a big project for the summer, but luckily, I think it is working out.</description>
