&lt;p&gt;This edited collection provides theoretical background for a hypothetical first-year composition class. Coxwell-Teague and Lunsford ask the contributors&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;ldquo;what they would do if they taught semester-long first-year composition course at their schools and if they knew such courses were to be the only college-level composition course the students would take&amp;rdquo; (preface viii)? Each chapter is separated into two halves: theoretical frame and a syllabus. In the first section of each chapter, the contributors offer the rationales for their design of the course, each highly representative of their own interests and their contexts. The second half of the chapter are supplementary materials, each with a syllabus, and many with assignment sheets. Overall, the collection offers a snapshot of what many scholars in Rhetoric and Composition see as the important features of this class. There are many commonalities among them, where FYC does not focus on grammar, persuasion, or on the &amp;ldquo;improvement of writing&amp;rdquo;. Overall, the collection offers an interesting look at what the core teaching practices and focuses of the discipline are, and where they fit within First-Year composition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This edited collection rethinks and theorizes what writing is. With this theoretical exploration&lt;/p&gt;

Oxford UP, Oxford, 2002.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This edited collection examines issues of curriculum design, teacher preparation, graduate teaching assistants, labor, pedagogy, and practice. It has an extensive list of contributors &lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and the chapters were organized around the themes histories, theories, programs, and practices. The provided chapters offer a snapshot into program design, preparation, curriculum, education, support, and local contexts for a variety of teaching assistants, adjuncts, faculty, and professors teaching college writing. The chapters tended to reflect the local nature of the program, outside of some that took a winder stance such as Yancey&amp;rsquo;s heuristic for curriculum design. Overall, the chapters tended to get repetitive, with many offering similar types of programs with various levels teacher preparation and support. There were things to be learned in terms of the framing, content, and ongoing programs that teachers of composition need, and how to structure programs and curriculums. This volume, as compared to the others, was light on theory but had lots of on-the-ground types of insights and explorations&lt;/p&gt;

Boyton/Cook, Portsmouth, 2009.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This edited collection examines issue surrounding the professionalization of composition and writing studies, especially as experienced by WPAs, and the people that they work with and for. There is a range of contributors&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, showcasing a variety of experiences and perspectives. There is an attention paid to issues of what counts as work and labor, and the issues that have arisen out of the teaching of composition and the development of writing programs under the administration of WPAs. Additionally, there are calls for continued work in detailing and accounting for the variety of work and labor that occurs within Writing Programs as expressed in their various local contexts. The chapters ranged in their discussions from history, to development of TA and WPA theory, and the real labor implications of the work of WPAs. There was a call for tenure line and tenured WPAs in institutions, for better accounting for teaching and administration as important intellectual work, and for implementing policies, procedures, and mindsets that help to address the labor and staffing inequities that are present in many writing programs. There were examinations of the labor of WPAs, adjuncts, full-time faculty, and GTAs. The most salient chapters dealt with the rhetorics of programs, their local context, and how they can be both theorized and implemented in more just and equitable ways. These chapters were also able to make some detailed analysis of programs, and offer some generalizable insights out of them. However, there were a number of chapters that were either not as strong, or dealt with an issues/exploration that seemed overly contextual, without adding to broader understandings of the labor of WPA work.&lt;/p&gt;
