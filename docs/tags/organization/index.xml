      <title>Organizing and Thinking: Themes and Goals</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about how to organize and work through all of this. Both in terms of templating, as well as in terms of theming and organization. I currently have the personal stuff offset in its own subfolder, which I would either like to figure out how to place into its own subdomain, or something. I will need to figure out how to do that. There are things that I like with this &lt;a href=&#34;https://themes.gohugo.io/academic/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Academic&lt;/a&gt; theme, especially in terms of it &amp;ldquo;looking&amp;rdquo; like a CV. And I like the idea, ultimately, of having a CV type academic site, with resources based on the different projects. To have data available, slides, references, etc. Speaking of which, I need to do that for my &lt;a href=&#34;http://michaelhealy.space/academic/talk/cccc2017&#34;&gt;CCCC&amp;rsquo;s talk&lt;/a&gt; from this year. I also like that there is a lot to customize, but that it largely just works, and is relatively well documented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should follow up on a bug, I think, but I also need to do more to learn some additional CSS. Oh well, one summer project at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am planning on adding a &amp;ldquo;book review&amp;rdquo; section here, as a way of thinking through the different things that I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading for the summer DIS. I also see this sort of scholarship archive, and my reactions to it&amp;ndash;more casual and blog like than publishable book review&amp;ndash;as a way of reflecting on and synthesizing my reading, as well as a means for creating a publicish archive. I&amp;rsquo;ll need to see how extensible this theme is before committing to it.&lt;/p&gt;
