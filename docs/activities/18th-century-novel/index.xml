      <description>Brown, Laura. “The Romance of Empire: Oroonoko and the Trade in Slaves.” End of Empire: Women and Ideology in Early Eighteenth-Century English Literature. Ithaca, NY: Cornell UP, 1993. 23-63.
In this chapter, Brown explores the tensions presented in Oroonoko, and their relationship to ongoing changes in class, ideology, race, and gender in the British colonies of the late 17th century. She examines the connections of race and gender, feminism and abolition, the construction of the other, and how they intersect within this “particular stage in the history of British capitalism associated broadly with commodity exchange and colonialist exploitation” (34).</description>
