      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about how to organize and work through all of this. Both in terms of templating, as well as in terms of theming and organization. I currently have the personal stuff offset in its own subfolder, which I would either like to figure out how to place into its own subdomain, or something. I will need to figure out how to do that. There are things that I like with this Academic theme, especially in terms of it &amp;ldquo;looking&amp;rdquo; like a CV.</description>

      <description>After a presentation and conversation with Alex Gil, I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen, as a summer project, to re-do my personal website, for a few reasons:
 To better know the technologies I use. To better, and more openly, represent my work. To have more control over my making. I would like to know where the things I&amp;rsquo;m doing are going. To get off of a self-hosted Wordpress site.  These is a big project for the summer, but luckily, I think it is working out.</description>
