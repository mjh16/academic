    <div class="article-style">
      
      This is an idea that is relatively new, but I think there is great promise in it. Working through the process of performing the revision narrative has been an interesting one. Its one that I knew wouldn&#8217;t be easy, but has also proven to be more difficult than I had at first imagined.
[aesop_character img=&#8221;<a href="http://www.michaelhealy.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img_0415-e1462474741733.jpg&amp;#8221" target="_blank">http://www.michaelhealy.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img_0415-e1462474741733.jpg&amp;#8221</a>; name=&#8221;Process&#8221; align=&#8221;left&#8221; width=&#8221;40%&#8221; force_circle=&#8221;off&#8221;]
&nbsp;
The first thing has been purely logistical. In performing this on my WordPress site, I have had flexibility to move and connect things as I would like, to relate posts together through smart linking and decision trees.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      You open up healy.gwp.draft2.
  [aesop_character img=&#8221;<a href="http://www.michaelhealy.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img_0406.jpg&amp;#8221" target="_blank">http://www.michaelhealy.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img_0406.jpg&amp;#8221</a>; name=&#8221;Revision&#8221; align=&#8221;center&#8221; width=&#8221;100%&#8221; force_circle=&#8221;off&#8221;]  It&#8217;s time to get serious with this article! There are a number of reasons for your wanting to do this. First, you really like this idea, think it has great potential, works with your interests, and you&#8217;ve had some luck using it in your own classrooms. In fact, this semester the workshop quest seemed to work really well for a number of your students, with them starting to better see the connections between peer-review and their work, both as readers and as writers.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      You stare at the open document. You&#8217;ve pulled together quotes and research notes. The weight of doing the revisions in situ seem overwhelming. You open a new document, title it Literature Review, and start typing.
You start with the major moves that you&#8217;ve seen in connecting to your own work. You create a set of bullet points that lay out your thoughts and the themes you see.
 Process and Revision Peer-Review and Troubles Workshop as a collaborative and process space Multimodality/Literacy/Connections between Peer-Review, Workshop, Gaming Gamification as a Method of Connecting Process, Peer-Review, and Collaboration in the Workshop  Once you&#8217;ve laid it out and see the major moves, you start typing away.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      Within this particular pedagogy students are asked to go back through their writing process and to create an interactive revision text. This is set up as a way for students to think about and play with memory. It is a way for them to engage with their writing in their memory as they account for how it came into being. There are a few pieces of this assignment that seem important.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      You lace up your shoes, your new shoes, the Altra Torin 2.0s. The ones you just got last week. The ones that feel good in the way that only new shoes can. You head out into the neighborhood, your work on the tip of your mind. You click your watch to record the miles and head out.
You return home after about a 30-45 minutes, somewhere between 3 and 5 miles done.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      You stare at the literature review section of your article. This is one section that you really need to revise. It is unclear what work you&#8217;ve done, what the gap is, and how you fit in. Come on Michael, you can do this.
You open Evernote and locate your research notes. First you create a list with the movements of the research. You have questions like &#8220;Why do peer review?&#8221; and &#8220;Why is it difficult?

    <div class="article-style">
      
      Instead of doing any writing you choose to go back and do more research. You&#8217;ve already read three books in relationship to this article by now. What else do you need? Oh well.
Hours later, and no further writing on your draft, you have a new stack of articles that seem related. You&#8217;ve also thought about other potentials for revision, peer-review, creative writing, and multimodality that need researching.
You decide that you could research forever if you wanted to.

      Whoa, that was a lot of work. I hope that you haven&#8217;t been lost. I&#8217;ve often felt lost as I&#8217;ve explored these areas, memories, and my own process. Now that that&#8217;s out of the way, lets continue back on to adventure.
You rename the document &#8220;healy.gwp.draft1&#8221; and read through your work. There are some decent ideas here. You like what you&#8217;ve done. However, given the reading, there is a big gap in the theory section.

      You find yourself sitting in a room. There is a computer in front of you playing music. There is a cup of coffee on the desk.
You take a drink and start to type.
You&#8217;ve been working on a piece that you&#8217;ve titled: &#8220;It’s Dangerous to Go Alone! Take This&#8221;: Co-op Play and the Gamified Workshop.&#8221; It&#8217;s a piece that you&#8217;ve been working on since taking Creative Writing Pedagogy last fall.
