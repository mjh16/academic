Some Notes about the site:
I've commented out the menu items for stuff that doesn't, currently, matter like publications. Though I do intend to get that populated with some stuff soon!
Also, I've made content/home/publications_selected.md and content/home/publications.md both drafts, so that the widgets won't display on the home page. Once those have both been stuff to populate, uncomment the menu item in config.toml and undraft the two widgets in the front matter.
